The responsive buying action in the asset from 135.80 looks so confident amid weakness in the Japanese Yen as Bank of Japan (BoJ) policymakers are considering the current expansionary monetary policy as appropriate to maintain the 2% inflation confidently. National Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Japan has reached to multi-decade high near 4.2%. However, the major contributor to the elevated inflation is the higher import prices, not the strong wage gains and any resilience in the domestic demand. Therefore, the BoJ policymakers are advocating more stimulus in the economy so that the pre-pandemic growth levels could be achievable. After dovish commentary from BoJ Governor Nominee Kazuo Ueda, BoJ Deputy Governor Ryozo Himino favored the sustenance of easy monetary policy to spurt the overall demand in the Japanese economy. However, he assured that a time will come when an exit from the ultra-loose monetary policy will be optimal. Meanwhile, the risk profile is also not supporting the risk-sensitive assets as more rate hikes are highly expected from the Federal Reserve to strengthen its competence against the stick United States inflation.

Earlier in the day, the Euro found bids on the back of higher-than-expected French inflation data, which sent short-dated euro zone yields to their highest in at least a decade. Then, at the start of the US day, the pair rallied to 1.0645 when US data showed signs that the Fed's rate hikes were beginning to have their intended effect and in contrast to a slew of prior inflationary outcomes. ''Base effects from last year’s Russian invasion of Ukraine should start to bring annual inflation down from March, but theECBwill be primarily concerned with sequential monthly inflation increases,'' analysts at ANZ Bank said. ''German and euro area inflation data will be released in coming days and will provide a more complete inflation backdrop for the March Governing Council meeting.''

In doing so, the Cable pair justifies the previous day’s pullback from an important resistance, as well as the looming bear cross on the MACD. While the failure to cross the 1.2110 hurdle, comprising 200-Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and a one-month-old downward-sloping resistance line, keeps the GBP/USD bears hopeful, a clear break of the 1.2100 threshold becomes necessary for the seller’s conviction. Following that, the “double bottom” bullish formation around 1.1920-15 will be crucial to watch as a downside break of the same won’t hesitate to drag the GBP/USD price towards January’s low near 1.1840. Alternatively, the pair’s recovery past the 1.2110 resistance confluence needs to cross a one-week-long horizontal resistance near 1.2150 to convince GBP/USD buyers. In that case, the mid-February swing high of 1.2270 appears the imminent target for the bulls ahead of aiming for the previous monthly top surrounding 1.2400. It should, however, be noted that the pair’s sustained trading beyond 1.2400 will be difficult as the multiple tops around 1.2445-50 could challenge the bulls afterward.

That said, the major currency pair marked the biggest monthly loss since the last September before marking the latest corrective bounce. In doing so, the Euro pair takes clues from the broad US Dollar pullback amid a month-start sluggish session and pre-data anxiety. It’s worth noting that the upbeat prints of inflation numbers from Spain and France join China-inspired favor to the risk-on mood to also underpin the EUR/USD rebound. That said, the preliminary readings of Spanish and French Consumer Price Index (CPI) details for February marked upbeat outcomes and bolstered the hawkish concerns surrounding the European Central Bank’s (ECB) next move on Tuesday. On the contrary, the US Conference Board’s (CB) Consumer Confidence dropped for the second consecutive month to 102.9 versus 106.0 prior (revised) while US Housing Price Index drops 0.1% in December versus -0.6% market forecasts and -0.1% prior. Furthermore, Chicago Purchasing Managers’ Index for February eased to 43.6 from 44.3 previous readings and 45.0 market consensus whereas the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index for the said month eased below 11.0 prior and -5.0 expected to -16. It should be noted that strong prints of China’s Caixin and NBS Manufacturing PMIs for February joins the Non-Manufacturing PMI for the said month to mark an upbeat economic rebound in the world’s biggest industrial player and favored the risk profile. Even so, China Finance Minister Liu He said after the data release that the foundation of China's economic recovery is still not stable. Against this backdrop, S&P 500 Futures turn positive after initially tracking Wall Street’s mild losses. However, the firmer US Treasury bond yields and hawkish Fed bets, as well as the global inflation woes, keep the US Dollar on the bull’s radar. That said, the USDollar Index(DXY) clings to mild losses near 104.85 after February’s impressive north-run. Looking ahead, the first readings of Germany’s key inflation gauge for February, namely the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), could challenge the pair’s upside momentum on missing the upbeat 0.7% MoM forecasts, versus 0.5% prior. Also important to watch are the S&P Global and ISM PMI details for February. Technical analysis The EUR/USD pair’s multiple failures to cross the 50-bar Exponential Moving Average (EMA), around 1.0620, join the receding bullish bias of the MACD signals to favor sellers.

The monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) (Jan) dropped significantly to 7.4% from the expectations of 8.0% and the prior release of 8.4%. A mammoth decline in the inflation data is going to provide a big relief to Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) policymakers. The Reserve Bank of Australia has been making efforts in bringing down inflationary pressures by the continuation of policy tightening. Reserve Bank of AustraliaGovernor Philip Lowehas already pushed its Official Cash Rate (OCR) to 3.35% in order to tame the stubborn inflation. And, more rates must be in pipeline to achieve price stability sooner.

On an annualized basis, the GDP has remained in line with expectations at 2.7%. A decline in GDP numbers also showcases lower demand from households, which will trim inflation projections ahead as producers will be forced to scale down the prices of their offerings. Upbeat Caixin Manufacturing PMI strengthens the Australian Dollar It was widely anticipated that China’s manufacturing sector will outperform after the rollback of strict lockdown measures. Chinese administration and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) are dedicated to spurring economic recovery by improving domestic demand. The IHS Markit reported the Caixin Manufacturing PMI data at 51.6, higher than the expectations of 50.2 and the former release of 49.2. Apart from that, China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) Manufacturing PMI (Feb) landed higher at 52.6 vs. the consensus of 50.5 and the prior release of 50.1. The Services Manufacturing PMI exploded to 56.3 against 54.4 released in January while the street was anticipating a downbeat figure at 49.7. It is worth noting that Australia is the leading trading partner of China and a sharp recovery in the Chinese economy is also supportive of the Australian Dollar. ISM Manufacturing PMI- the next trigger for the US Dollar The street is awaiting the release of the United States Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing PMI data. As per the consensus, the economic data is seen at 48.0 from the former release of 47.4. Apart from that, the New Orders Index that conveys forward demand is expected to rebound to 43.7 from the prior figure of 42.5. It is worth noting that the Manufacturing PMI is in a contraction phase consecutively for the past three months. A figure below 50.0 is considered as a contraction in the extent of activities. Federal Reserve policymakers are expected to keenly watch the PMI figures as a surprise upside could strengthen the expectations of more hikes ahead.

The intraday positive move picks up pace during the early European session and lifts spot prices to a fresh daily high, around the 1.2085 region in the last hour. TheUS Dollarretreats from a multi-week high touched on Tuesday, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor pushing the GBP/USD pair higher. The upbeat Chinese PMI prints for February fuel optimism that a recovery in the world's second-largest economy is gaining steam and boosts investors' confidence. This is evident from signs of stability around the equity markets and weighs heavily on the safe-haven Greenback. TheBritish Pound, on the other hand, draws additional support from the new UK-EU agreement on the Northern Ireland protocol, which eliminates the risk of a potential trade war between the two sides. Adding to this, rising bets for additional rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE) lend some support to the GBP/USD pair. Some analysts, however, still hope that the UK central bank would pause the current tightening cycle. In contrast, the Federal Reserve is universally expected to stick to its hawkish stance for longer in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. This remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and should act as a tailwind for the USD. Moreover, worries about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs should cap any optimism in the markets and contribute to limiting losses for the safe-haven buck. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying before positioning for an extension of the GBP/USD pair's solid bounce from a technically significant 200-day SMA.

The momentum lifts spot prices to a fresh weekly high, around the 0.6775-0.6780 region in the last hour, with bulls now eyeing to test the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) support breakpoint. The upbeat Chinese data benefits the China-proxy Australian Dollar and prompts aggressive short-covering around the AUD/USD pair amid a sharp intradayUS Dollardownfall. In fact, the official Chinese PMI prints for February indicated that business activity in the country rose to pre-COVID levels and that recovery in the world's second-largest economy is gaining steam. This largely offsets the softer-than-expected Australian macro data. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the economy expanded by 0.5% in the three months to December, lower than the 0.8% expected and 0.6% in the previous quarter. On an annualized basis, fourth quarter GDP rose 2.7%, as expected, though marked a significant slowdown from the 5.9% growth recorded in the previous quarter. Another report showed that Consumer Price Index (CPI) missed market estimates and decelerated from 8.4% to 7.4% in January. The latest optimism, meanwhile, leads to a modest recovery in the global risk sentiment and weighs heavily on the safe-haven Greenback. This, in turn, is seen as another factor pushing the AUD/USD pair higher, though hawkish Fed expectations and looming recession risks could keep a lid on any further gains. The markets seem convinced that the Federal Reserve will stick to its hawkish stance for longer in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. This remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and supports prospects for the emergence of some USD dip-buying. Furthermore, investors remain worried about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs. Adding to this, geopolitical tensions should cap any optimism in the markets and cap the risk-sensitiveAussie. This, in turn, warrants some caution before confirming that the pair has formed a near-term bottom. From a technical perspective, the pair formed a Japanese candlestick tweezer-bottom pattern over Monday and Tuesday, and this, followed by today's strong bullish green candle suggests a strong possibility of, at least, a short-term counter-trend rally evolving. The measured move that began at the February 2 highs and has seen the AUD/USD fall over 450 pips in the month of February appears to have completed, further suggesting bears may take a breather, allowing bulls freer reign. Market participants now look to the US economic docket, featuring the release of theISMManufacturing PMIlater during the early North American session.

Welcome news, but not a game changer “The global risk environment and a potential narrowing in UK-Eurozone interest rate differentials are likely to prove more important drivers of Sterling than the new UK-EU deal.” “Our preference is for EUR/GBP to find support in the 0.87/0.88 area and end the year closer to 0.89/0.90.” “GBP/USD is a different story, where we continue to look for some Federal Reserve easing by the end of the year and a weaker Dollar.

Spot prices slide closer to the mid-135.00s during the first half of the European session, though any meaningful corrective decline seems elusive. A sharpUS Dollarretracement slide from a multi-week high turns out to be a key factor exerting some pressure on the USD/JPY pair. The downside, however, is likely to remain limited, at least for the time being, amid the divergent Bank of Japan(BoJ)-Fed monetary policyoutlook. This, in turn, warrants some caution for aggressive bearish traders and positioning for deeper losses. In fact, the incoming BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda and Deputy Governor nominee Shinichi Uchida recently stressed the need to maintain the ultra-loose monetary policy to support the fragile domestic economy. In contrast, the US central bank is universally expected to stick to its hawkish stance for longer and continue hiking interest rates in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. The prospects for further policy tightening by the Fed remain supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and favour the USD bulls. Apart from this, signs of stability in the equity markets, bolstered by the upbeat Chinese PMIs, could undermine demand for the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY). This, in turn, should lend some support to the USD/JPY pair and help limit the downside. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before confirming that the USD/JPY pair's recent appreciating move witnessed over the past month or so has run out of steam. From a technical perspective the defence of the trendline drawn joining the February 2 with the February 24 lows, and underpins the current day's lows at roughly 135.30, may be critical, and as long as it holds bulls have the upper hand. A decisive break and close below this trendline on the 4-hr or daily chart, however, would forsee momentum pick up on the downside, and the probable reversal of the short-term trend from positive to negative. Traders now look forward to the release of the USISMManufacturing PMI. This, along with the US bond yields, will influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to the major.

However, some subcomponents show that again prices are rising. The USD/JPY is exchanging hands at 136.08. USD/JPY continues to consolidate after mixed US ISM Manufacturing PMI US equities are trading mixed after the release of the ISM. The reading came at 47.7, below estimates of 48 for February, meaning that factories still feel the impact of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) aggression. Delving into the report, the Prices Index rose to 51.3, past the 45.1 estimates, spurring a knee-jerk reaction in the USDollar Index(DXY), and the USD/JPY spiked to 136.31. Lately, investors have turned less optimistic about inflation in the United States (US). Money market futures are pricing the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) at around 5.25% -5.50% by June 2023, and no rate cuts throughout the year. Earlier, S&P Global Manufacturing PMI for the US came shorter than the prior’s month data, at 47.3 vs. 47.8, a prelude of what was coming, later with data released by the ISM. Federal Reserve officials insist on their hawkish rhetoric led by Neil Kashkari, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. He said interest rates should reach 5.4% in December and stay at that level. He also mentioned that he would consider increasing rates by either 25 or 50 basis points during the upcoming Fed meeting and added that the dangers associated with not tightening monetary policy are greater than those of tightening it too much. Contrarily, Atlanta’sFed President Raphael Bosticbelieved that rates need to go as high as 5% - 5.25% and stood there “well into 2024.” He added that the economy has the momentum to support higher rates without a major downturn. Despite the hawkishness provided by Kashkari, the USD/JPY failed to edge higher. Additionally, rising UST yields, like the 10-year benchmark note rate, approach the 4% threshold, but sentiment keeps USD/JPY traders on the sidelines, waiting for additional US economic data. USD/JPY Technical analysis The USD/JPY daily chart shows the major consolidating at around 136.00. Back-to-back doji’s in the daily time frame suggest that buyers and sellers are at equilibrium. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is almost flat but nearby overbought conditions, while the Rate of Change (RoC) indicates sellers are gathering momentum. For a bullish resumption, the USD/JPY must clear the YTD high of 136.91, so the pair might test 138.00. Otherwise, a fall below 135.25 would pave the way toward 135.00.  What to watch?

It’s worth noting that a sustained break of the 50-EMA level surrounding 1.0665 could trigger the pair’s jump towards a 1.5-month-old horizontal resistance area near 1.0810. Following that, the January 2023 peak of around 1.0930 could act as an extra filter towards the north before directing the EUR/USD bulls to the previous monthly top of 1.1033. On the flip side, a daily closing beneath the 1.0535-30 support confluence, including the 200-EMA and aforementioned Fibonacci retracement level, appears a tough nut to crack for the EUR/USD bears. Even if the EUR/USD price breaks the 1.0530 support, lows marked during January 2023 and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, respectively around 1.0480 and 1.0380, could try defending the pair buyers before welcoming the bears.

Amid these plays, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields rose to the highest levels since early November 2022 by piercing the 4.0% mark whereas the two-year counterpart rallied to the highest levels since June 2007 by flashing the 4.91% mark at the latest.  The jump in the US Treasury bond yields portrays the market’s fears, which in turn probed bulls on Wall Street and weigh on S&P 500 Futures as of late.

Today, EUR could advance further to 1.0705. The major resistance at 1.0750 is unlikely to come into view.

We did not anticipate the strong rise in EUR to 1.0691. While the strong rise suggests there is scope for EUR to strengthen further, any advance is likely part of a corrective rebound. At this stage, the chance of a sustained rise above 1.0750 is not high.

In doing so, the major currency pair justifies the broad US Dollar strength ahead of the key Eurozone inflation numbers and a speech from the European Central Bank (ECB) PresidentChristine Lagarde. That said, USDollar Index(DXY) extends the bounce off a one-week low to 104.70 at the latest, up 0.27% intraday, as the hawkish bias of the major central bank officials joins inflation fears to propel the yields. Also adding strength to the US Dollar could be the upbeat details of the US ISMManufacturing PMIfor February. On the contrary, Germany’s Inflation number, per the Consumer Price Index (CPI), stayed unchanged at 8.7% YoY for February versus 8.5% expected. However, the annual Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the ECB's preferred gauge of inflation, edged higher to 9.3% from 9.2% in January, compared to analysts' estimate of 9%. On Wednesday, Minneapolis Federal Reserve (Fed) President Neel Kashkari reiterated his previous calls for higher interest rates while citing the fears emanating from the services inflation. On the same line, ECB Governing Council member Madis Muller said, “Rate hikes are having an effect but inflation is still too high.” Further, ECB policymakers Joachim Nagel and Francois Villeroy de Galhau also highlighted the inflation fears to suggest the need for higher rates. It should be noted that the fading optimism over China’s economic growth recently joined the fears of the Sino-American tussles and exerted additional downside pressure on the EUR/USD prices. Against this backdrop, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields rose to the highest levels since early November 2022 by piercing the 4.0% mark, around 4.02% at the latest, whereas the two-year counterpart rallied to the highest levels since June 2007 by flashing the 4.92% mark by the press time.  The jump in the US Treasury bond yields portrays the market’s fears, which in turn probed bulls on Wall Street and weigh on S&P 500 Futures as of late. Looking ahead, the first readings of February’sEurozoneConsumer Price Index (CPI) and the ECB’s preferred inflation gauge, namely HICP, will be crucial for the EUR/USD traders to watch for clear directions.

The pair currently trades around the 136.70 region, with bulls awaiting a sustained strength beyond the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 136.70 before placing fresh bets. The pair is pushed higher by theUS Dollar, which regains positive traction and reverses a part of the previous day's sharp retracement slide from a multi-week high amid a further rise in the US Treasury bond yields. In fact, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond climbs further beyond the 4.0% threshold, hitting its highest level since November 2022, and remains well supported by expectations for further policy tightening by the Fed. The markets seem convinced that the US central bank will keep interest rates higher for longer than previously estimated in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. The bets were lifted by the overnight hawkish remarks by AtlantaFed President Raphael Bostic, reiterating the view that the policy rate needs to rise to the 5.00%-5.25% range and remain at that level well into 2024 (it is currently at 4.57%). Adding to this, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari reiterated that inflation in the US is still very high and that their job is to bring it down. Kashkari also noted that the risk of under-tightening is greater than the risk of over-tightening.  Furthermore, the US ISM Manufacturing Index showed that the Prices Paid sub-component accelerated to 51.3 in February from 44.5, further supporting then inflation narrative. The Japanese Yen (JPY), on the other hand, is undermined by the recent dovish remarks by the incoming BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda and Deputy Governor nominee Shinichi Uchida, stressing the need to maintain the ultra-loose monetary policy.  That said, the cautious market mood - amid looming recession risks - could benefit the JPY's safe-haven status and cap the upside for the USD/JPY pair. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for a convincing breakout through the 100-day SMA barrier before positioning for an extension of the recent appreciating move witnessed over the past month or so. Market participants now look forward to the release of the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims data from the US, due later during the early North American session. Lower-than-expected Claims will continue to support the US Dollar and provide a bullish underpinning for USD/JPY. This, along with the US bond yields, will drive the USD demand and USD/JPY price dynamics.

The downward trajectory drags spot prices back closer to mid-1.1900s in the last hour and well within the striking distance of a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). A combination of factors assists theUS Dollarto regain strong positive traction, which, in turn, is seen exerting some downward pressure on the GBP/USD pair. The prospects for further policy tightening by the Fed continue to push the US Treasury bond yields higher. Apart from this, a softer risk tone - amid looming recession risks - lends additional support to the safe-haven Greenback. Investors seem convinced that the Fed will stick to its hawkish stance in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. Furthermore, the incoming US macro data pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs and should allow the Fed to keep rates higher for longer. Moreover, FOMC policymaker Neel Kashkari opened the door for a 50 bps hike at the next meeting in March. Kashkari noted that the risk of under-tightening is greater than the risk of over-tightening as inflation in the US is still very high. Separately, AtlantaFed President Raphael Bosticmaintained the view the policy rate needs to rise to the 5.00%-5.25% range and remain at that level well into 2024. This, in turn, remains supportive of elevated US bond yields and continues to underpin the Greenback. In fact, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond climbs further beyond the 4.0% threshold, to its highest level since November 2022, further fueling worries about economic headwinds stemming from rising borrowing costs. Apart from this, anxiety over the new UK-UKBrexitdeal on the Northern Ireland Protocol weighs on theBritish Poundand drags the GBP/USD pair lower. The price action, meanwhile, indicates that additional rate hike by theBank of England(BoE) is already fully priced in the markets. Moreover, some analysts still hope that the UK central bank would pause the current tightening cycle, suggesting that the path of least resistance for the GBP/USD pair is to the downside. Spot prices, however, might still find some support near the 200-day SMA. Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop now seems tilted firmly in favour of bearish traders. Hence, any attempted recovery could be seen as a selling opportunity and runs the risk of fizzling out rather quickly.

Despite the weekly erratic performance, the pair manages well to keep the trade in the positive territory after bottoming out in the 1.0535/30 band last week. No reaction in the FX universe after ChairwomanLagardereiterated that a 50 bps rate hike remains on the table at the March meeting, at the time when she added that decisions on the future rate path will be data dependent, although how far up rates could go remains uncertain. She also noted that inflation remains too high and that she does not see a recession in the region. In the docket, advanced inflation figures in the Euroland now see the headline CPI rising 8.5% in the year to February and 5.6% when it comes to the Core CPI.

In the meantime, price action around the European currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the potential next moves from the ECB after the bank has already anticipated another 50 bps rate raise at the March event. Back to the euro area, recession concerns now appear to have dwindled, which at the same time remain an important driver sustaining the ongoing recovery in the single currency as well as the hawkish narrative from the ECB.

The pair is currently placed around the 0.6725-0.6720 region and remains well within the striking distance of its lowest level since early January low touched the previous day. TheUS Dollarregains positive traction and reverses a part of the previous day's sharp retracement slide from a multi-week top, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor weighing on the AUD/USD pair. Growing acceptance that the Fed will stick to its hawkish stance for longer continues to push the US Treasury bond yields higher. Apart from this, the prevalent cautious market mood - amid looming recession risks - further benefits the safe-haven Greenback and contributes to driving flows away from the risk-sensitiveAussie. The markets seem convinced that the US central bank will continue to tighten its monetary policy in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. Moreover, the incoming US macro data pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs and should allow the Fed to keep interest rates higher. Adding to this, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari opened the door for a 50 bps hike at the next meeting in March and lifts the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond to its highest level since November. Meanwhile, the overnight optimism led by the upbeat Chinese PMI prints for February fades rather quickly amid looming recession risk. This is evident from a generally softer tone around the equity markets, which lends additional support to the USD and suggests that the path of least resistance for the AUD/USD pair is to the downside. That said, it will still be prudent to wait for sustained weakness below the 0.6700 mark before placing fresh bearish bets and positioning for a further near-term depreciating move. Market participants now look forward to the release of the Weekly Initial Jobless Claims data from the US, due later during the early North American session. This, along with the US bond yields and the broader risk sentiment, should influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to the AUD/USD pair.

The pair is currently placed below the mid-1.1900s, down over 0.60% for the day, and remains well within the striking distance of the weekly low touched on Monday. Looking at the broader picture, the GBP/USD pair is trading just above a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) support, currently pegged around the 1.1920-1.1915 region.  The said area coincides with the lower end of a short-term trading range witnessed over the past two weeks or so, which constitutes the formation of a rectangle on the daily chart. Given that oscillators on the daily have just started gaining negative traction, a convincing break below a technically significant SMA will be seen as a fresh trigger for bearish traders. The GBP/USD could then slide towards retesting the YTD low, around the 1.1840 area set in January, which if broken will complete a bearish double-top pattern formed near the 1.2445-1.2450 region. On the flip side, attempted recovery moves might now confront stiff resistance near the 1.2000 psychological mark ahead of the daily swing high, around the 1.2035 region and the 1.2065-1.2070 supply zone. Any subsequent move-up could attract fresh sellers near the 1.2100 mark and remain capped near the 50-day SMA strong barrier, currently around the 1.2135-1.2140 area. Some follow-through buying has the potential to lift the GBP/USD pair towards the 1.2200 round-figure mark en route to the February 14 swing high, around the 1.2265-1.2270 region. A sustained strength beyond the latter will suggest that the slide from the 1.2445-1.2450 supply zone has run its course and shift the near-term bias back in favour of bullish traders.

That is the next key target that would help to switch the bias around a bit and give the ""buy low crowd"", some confidence.

Reasons like unemployment claims in the United States (US) easing triggered investors’ reaction, that perhaps their inflation view is wrong, sending US bond yield skyrocketing. Hence, the US Dollar (USD) strengthened to the Euro (EUR) detriment. At the time of writing, the EUR/USD trades at 1.0575. The US Department of Labor (DoL), revealed that the number of people who filed for unemployment benefits for the first time in the week ending on February 25 was 190K, which was lower than the 195K predicted by experts. The market reacted negatively, sending US Treasury bond yields above the 4% threshold and underpinning the US Dollar. The EUR/USD tumbled below 1.0600 on the initial reaction following US Initial Jobless Claims data, while the US Dollar rallied. At the time of typing, the USDollar Index(DXY), a measure of the buck’s value vs. a basket of six currencies, advances 0.73%, at 105.141. On the Euroarea inflationary figures were unveiled. The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), rose 8.5% YoY, above the previous month’s 8.6%. However, the reading missed the market expectations of 8.2%. Excluding volatile items, the so-called core inflation, on its annual reading, printed at 5.6%, higher than the previous and expected 5.3%. Even though figures were higher than expected, investors had already priced in a 50 bps rate hike by the European Central Bank (ECB) as announced by its President ChristineLagardein its last meeting presser. However, recent data have ECB policymakers split on what signal the bank should send to the markets. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the ECB are expected to raise rates. The former would likely hike 25 bps, as shown by money market futures, but further data to be revealed ahead of March’s meeting could put into discussion a 50 bps rate hike. On the European side, the ECB is leaning toward 50 bps, though recent data could open the door for higher rates. EUR/USD Technical analysis After rallying toward the weekly high of 1.0691, the EUR/USD plunges, erasing almost its Wednesday gains. The EUR/USD clashed with the 20 and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 1.0664 and 1.0657, respectively, and has reached a daily low of 1.0576. Albeitthe EUR/USD pairturned south, its bias remains neutral, but a daily close below 1.0600 could pave the way for further downside. Therefore, the EUR/USD first support would be the March 2 daily low of 1.0576. Break below, and the 100-day EMA at 1.0550 would be tested by sellers ahead of falling to the 200-day EMA at 1.0533. Conversely, the EUR/USD first resistance would be the psychological 1.0600 figure.

Moving below that level would have increased the bearish bias for the EURUSD (see post here).  Instead the price has rotated back to the upside and looks back toward the 100 hour moving average 1.0603 -  and above that -  the 200 hour moving average 1.06171.  If the pair is able to get up above those levels, it would tilt the short term bearish bias back in favor of the buyers. USDJPY: Looking at the USDJPY, it moved back above its 100 day moving average 136.901, and approached the high price for the day at 137.097. The 200 day moving average is above that 100 day MA at at 137.234. However, the Bostic comments have since pushed the price back below the 100 day moving average, dodging that bullish bias shift.

On the downside the rising 100 hour moving average at 136.308 is the next key target to get to and through if the bias is to start a short-term shift more to the downside.  That level is still 40 or so pips away, but the price is also back below the 100 day moving average.  The battle continues between sellers against the daily moving averages and buyers against the 100 hour moving average (and below that the 200 hour moving average - green line). GBPUSD: The GBPUSD moved back down to test its 200 day moving average of 1.19706. That was also near the low price from Monday near the same level.

IF the GBPUSD can get above that moving average, it would avert closing below that key MA level for the first time since November 9.

One economist had a peak of 4.35% in the third quarter. Several economists foresee trouble ahead for the Australian economy, partly because higher interest rates have already slowed activity in the housing market, where prices are expected to fall more than double the correction during the 2008 financial crisis.

The asset has picked strength as the Statistics Bureau of Japan has conveyed that Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) softened heavily in February. The annual headline CPI has dropped to 3.4% from the consensus of 4.1% and the prior release of 4.4%. Contrary to that, the core CPI that excludes the impact of energy and food prices have improved to 3.2% from 3.1% as expected and the former release of 3.0%. It seems like the inflationary pressures have been exceptionally battered by the recent fall in food and energy prices. A decline in headline Tokyo inflation indicates that the impact of higher energy and food prices has started fading now, therefore, it could be considered that Tokyo inflation has peaked for now. Reuters reported that “The pace of inflation slowed due in part to the government's energy subsidies to ease the pain on households from soaring electricity bills.” It is worth noting that the novel Bank of Japan (BoJ) leadership has been favoring current monetary policy, which is expansionary in nature, as inflation is coming from international forces and not from domestic demand.

That said, the Euro pair bounces off the support line of the two-week-long symmetrical triangle during early Friday while paring the previous day’s losses. It’s worth noting, however, that the bearish MACD signals join the major currency pair’s sustained trading below the 200-Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to challenge the bull's bias. As a result, the latest rebound appears difficult below the aforementioned triangle’s top line of near 1.0675, as well as the 200-EMA level surrounding 1.0685. In a case where the EUR/USD price rallies beyond the 1.0685 hurdle, the 1.0700 threshold may act as a validation point for the run-up targeting the mid-February swing high surrounding 1.0800. On the contrary, a downside break of the stated triangle’s lower line, around 1.0580 by the press time, could join the bearish MACD signals to recall the EUR/USD sellers. In that situation, the weekly low surrounding 1.0530 could challenge the pair’s further downside ahead of January’s bottom near 1.0480. Overall, EUR/USD traders can ignore the pair’s latest rebound unless the quote breaks the 1.0685 hurdle. However, the downside room appears limited.

The economic data has landed at 55.0, higher than the consensus of 50.5 and the former release of 52.9. After the rollback of restrictions on the movement of men, materials, and machines, the Chinese economy is marching effectively on the path of economic recovery. The administration and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) are dedicated to spurring domestic demand by deploying more stimulus and reform measures. It is worth noting that Australia is the leading trading partner of China and higher service PMI in China will strengthen the Australian Dollar ahead. Meanwhile, a recent drop in the Australian monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) has failed to scale down hawkish expectations from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The monthly CPI (Jan) dropped significantly to 7.4% from the expectations of 8.0% and the prior release of 8.4%. None of the RBA policymakers has informed that Australian inflation has peaked now. Also, there is an extreme deviation between the current inflation and the desired one. Therefore, the RBA would maintain a hawkish stance for a longer period. A survey from Reuters on RBA’s interest rate guidance dictates that the central bank will hike its interest rate again by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.60% on Tuesday, followed by one more lift next quarter, before pausing until next year, taking the peak rate higher than previously thought.

That said, the Yen pair renews its intraday low near 136.50 during early Friday, snapping a two-day winning streak at the latest. In doing so, the quote remains pressured inside a one-week-old rising wedge bearish chart formation. It’s worth noting that the USD/JPY pair’s downside break of a short-term support line, now resistance around 137.00, on Thursday joined the bearish MACD signals to keep sellers hopeful of witnessing further declines. The same highlights the lower line of the aforementioned rising wedge, close to 135.85 by the press time, as the key support. It should be observed, however, that the 200-Hour Moving Average (HMA) level surrounding 135.60 acts as an extra filter towards the south before convincing the USD/JPY bears to aim for 132.80 theoretical target of the rising wedge, if at all the prices remain weak past 135.85. Meanwhile, a descending resistance line from the latest peak restricts the USD/JPY pair’s immediate upside near 136.75, a break of which will highlight the previous support line from Wednesday and the wedge’s top line, respectively around 137.00 and 137.20 at the latest.

Given the quote’s repeated bounces off the stated key support line, around 1.1940 by the press time, coupled with the downbeat RSI (14) suggesting an easing bearish bias, the GBP/USD price is likely to overcome the immediate resistance line, close to 1.1975 by the press time.

Following that, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the pair’s January month upside, near 1.2140, could act as an extra filter towards the north, a break of which could quickly propel the GBP/USD towards a horizontal area comprising levels marked since January 24, close to 1.2260-70.

The pair sticks to its intraday gains and is currently placed near the top end of the daily range, just a few pips below the 1.2000 psychological mark. A modest pullback in the US Treasury bond yields prompts some selling around theUS Dollar, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor pushing the GBP/USD pair higher. TheBritish Pounddraws additional support from rising bets for additional rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE). It is worth recalling that the BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said on Wednesday that some further increase in bank rates may turn out to be appropriate, though added that nothing is decided. This was followed by hawkish remarks by the BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill on Thursday, noting that Britain's economy is showing slightly more momentum than expected and pay growth is proving a bit faster than the central bankforecastlast month. The downside for the USD, however, seems cushioned, at least for the time being, amid firming expectations for further policy tightening by the Federal Reserve. The US CPI, PPI and the PCE Price Index released recently indicated that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped. Moreover, the incoming upbeat US macro data, including the Initial Jobless Claims on Thursday, pointed to an economy that remains resilient, which should allow the US central bank to stick to its hawkish stance for longer. Adding to this, a slew of FOMC members backed the case for higher rate hikes to tame stubbornly high inflation. This should act as a tailwind for the US bond yields and continue to lend some support to the Greenback. It is worth recalling that the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond rose to its highest level since last November and the rate-sensitive two-year Treasury note had shot to levels last seen in July 2007 on Thursday. This, along with the GBP/USD pair's two-way price action witnessed over the past four weeks or so, warrants some caution for aggressive traders and positioning for a firm near-term direction.

Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Yesterday, we expected USD to trade sideways between 135.40 and 136.60. However, USD rose briefly above 137.00 (high of 137.09) before retreating quickly. Despite the advance, upward momentum has barely improved. Today, there is scope for USD to edge higher but a break of 137.30 is unlikely. On the downside, a breach of 136.20 would indicate that the current mild upward pressure has eased.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We have held a positive USD view for more than 2 weeks now. In our most recent narrative from two days ago (01 Mar, spot at 136.35), we noted that USD ‘must break and hold above 136.90 in the next 1-2 days or the chances of a move to 137.90 will rapidly diminish’. While USD rose to a high of 137.09 in NY trade, it retreated and closed at 136.76. Upward momentum has improved a tad but while theoutlookfor USD is still positive, the major resistance at 137.90 could be out of reach this time around.

The momentum lifts spot prices to a fresh daily high, around the 0.6765 region in the last hour, and is sponsored by the emergence of fresh selling around theUS Dollar. A modest pullback in the US Treasury bond yields is turning out to be a key factor exerting some downward pressure on the buck. Adding to this, the upbeat Chinese macro data fueled optimism about a strong recovery in the world's second-largest economy, which further dents the Greenback's safe-haven status and provides an additional boost to the China-proxy Australian Dollar. That said, a combination of factors might hold back bulls from placing aggressive bets around the AUD/USD pair and keep a lid on any further gains, at least for the time being. Firming expectations that the Federal Reserve will stick to its hawkish stance for longer in the wake of stubbornly high inflation should act as a tailwind for the US bond yields and lend support to the USD. The bets were lifted by hawkish commentary by a slew of influential FOMC members, stressing the need for higher rate hikes to fully gain control over inflation. This had pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond to its highest level since last November and the rate-sensitive two-year Treasury note to levels last seen in July 2007 on Thursday. Furthermore, worries about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs continue to weigh on investors' sentiment. This is evident from the prevalent cautious mood around the equity markets, which should further help limit losses for the Greenback and contribute to capping the upside for the AUD/USD pair. Even from a technical perspective, the recent breakdown below the very important 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) favours bearish trades and suggests that the path of least resistance for spot prices remains to the downside. Market participants might also refrain from placing aggressive bets ahead of next week's Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) monetary policy meeting. In the meantime, traders on Friday will take cues from the US ISM Services PMI, due for release later during the early North American session. This, along with the US bond yields and the risk sentiment, will drive the USD demand and produce short-term trading opportunities around the AUD/USD pair.

EUR/USD now looks at US data EUR/USD keeps the choppy price action well and sound so far this week amidst an equally vacillating performance in the greenback, while yields on both sides of the ocean now give away some gains and investors continue to monitor messages from both the ECB and the Fed. On the latter, ECB’s Vice-President De Guindos suggested earlier that headline inflation should fall below 6% at some point in mid-year, at the time when he reiterated that decisions on future rate hikes will remain data-dependent and that the economy of the region is doing better than expected. His colleague Vasle left the door open to further rate raises after the March event, a view shared by Board member Müller. In addition, Müller was unable to predict how far up rates may go. In the domestic calendar, final figures saw Services PMI in Germany and the broader Euroland at 50.9 and 52.7, respectively, for the month of February. In addition, Producer Prices in the euro area contracted 2.8% MoM in January and rose 15% from a year earlier and earlier data saw Germany’s trade surplus widen to €16.7B in January.

In the meantime, price action around the European currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the potential next moves from the ECB after the bank has already anticipated another 50 bps rate raise at the March event.

The results suggested the American economy is still in fine form and the Fed will need to continue tightening policy aggressively in its wrestle with the beast of inflation. Nevertheless, gains proved temporary as the pair gradually fell back down to the lower 136s after the initial furious rally higher. TheISMNon-Manufactruing PMI data for February, showed a rise to 55.1, roundly beating expectations of 54.5, and almost pipping the previous month's 55.2.US Dollarpairs reacted immediately, and began rising as traders bet on the Federal Reserve having to step in with sterner disinflationary measures, perhaps even raising interest rates more aggressively than is currently expected, with probabilities steadily rising of the higher 50 bps rate hike coming from the Fed in March. The data also showed a rise in the Employment component of the survey, to 54.0 from 50.0 and New Orders to 62.6 from 60.4. Price Paid fell to 65.6 from 67.8, however, offsetting the hype marginally and suggesting a slight easing in inflationary forces. The Business Activity component, meanwhile showed a fall 56.3 from 60.4. From a technical perspective, the USD/JPY pair is in a short-to-medium term uptrend which is expected to extend given a lack of reversal signs so far. Yet lately it has struggled to break above the 100 and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) between 136.50 and 137.00 and these appear to be successfully baring further growth. If bulls can successfully break above them, however, it will also confirm a breakout through the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent pullback from over a three-decade high and pave the way for additional gains. The USD/JPY pair might then accelerate the move to reclaim the 138.00 mark en route to the 138.75 zone, the 139.00 round figure and the 139.60 region (50% Fibo. level). On the flip side, sustained weakness below the 136.00 level might prompt some technical selling and drag the USD/JPY pair to the weekly low, around the 135.25 region. It would require a break below the key 134.05 February 24 low – the last key higher low of the previous uptrend – to reverse the sequence of rising peaks and troughs and define the beginning of a new downtrend. A key event for the USD/JPY pair will be the Bank of Japan (BoJ) policy meeting next week. That said, a convincing break below the 134.05 low could make spot prices vulnerable to sliding further towards the 23.6% Fibo. level support, just ahead of the 133.00 mark.

2024-03-27,EURUSD,Neutral,When is the US ISM Services PMI and how could it affect EURUSD,Haresh Menghani,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/when-is-the-us-ism-services-pmi-and-how-could-it-affect-eur-usd-202303031356,FX Street,"US ISM Services PMI Overview The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) will release the Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) - also known as the ISM Services PMI – at 15:00 GMT this Friday. The gauge is expected to come in at 54.5 for February, down from 55.2 in the previous month. Given that the Fed looks more at inflation than growth, investors will keep a close eye on the Prices Paid sub-component, which is anticipated to decelerate from 67.8 in January to 64.5 during the reported month. Economists at ING offer a brief preview of the important macro data and write: “Consensus is centred around a marginal decrease from 55.2 to 54.5, which would confirm speculation on recession is too premature and would continue to endorse the Fed’s hawkish rhetoric. We think this should allow further stabilisation of the Dollar around current levels.” How Could it Affect EUR/USD? Ahead of the key release, retreating US Treasury bond yields prompts some selling around the US Dollar. This, along with the overnight hawkish comments by ECB President Christine Lagarde, assiststhe EUR/USD pairto regain positive traction on the last day of the week. Any disappointment from the US ISM Services PMI could exert additional downward pressure on the Greenback and continue pushing the pair higher. That said, the market reaction is more likely to remain limited amid growing acceptance that the Fed will continue to tighten its monetary policy to combat stubbornly high inflation. Hence, a stronger headline print and higher-than-expected Prices Paid Index should be enough to trigger a fresh leg up in the US bond yields, which, in turn, should help revive the USD demand. Apart from this, looming recession risks should continue to act as a tailwind for the safe-haven buck. This, in turn, suggests that the path of least resistance for the EUR/USD pair is to the downside and any subsequent move up might still be seen as a selling opportunity. Eren Sengezer, Editor atFXStreet, offers a brief technical outlook and outlines important technical levels to trade the major: “EUR/USD is currently trading slightly above the descending regression channel coming from early February. The 20-period and the 50-period Simple Moving Averages (SMA) reinforce that resistance area that aligns at 1.0610/1.0620. Once the pair stabilizes above that hurdle, it could target 1.0650/60 (Fibonacci 23.6% retracement of the latest downtrend, 100-period SMA), 1.0700 (psychological level) and 1.0720 (Fibonacci 38.2% retracement)..” “On the other hand, if the pair returns within the descending channel, sellers could take action and cause EUR/USD to slide toward 1.0560 (mid-point of the descending channel), 1.0540 (static level) and 1.0500 (psychological level, lower limit of the descending channel), .” Eren adds further.

2024-04-01,USDJPY,Positive,USDJPY holds the 200 hour MA for the 3rd time in 6 days,Greg Michalowski,https://www.forexlive.com/technical-analysis/usdjpy-holds-the-200-hour-ma-for-the-3rd-time-in-6-days-20230303/,Forex Live,"The 200 hour MA has been a magnet for the USDJPY over the last 6 trading days, but once reached, the price has seen a push away. That MA (green line in the chart above), was tested last Friday and bounced. It was tested on Wednesday this week and bounced. Today the price got within 5 or so pips of the MA, and once again bounced. That is 3 tests in 6 days and 3 bounces. If you go back to February 10, after a failed break below the 200 hour MA, that same MA based the pair before moving higher. The point is... the 200 hour MA has been a bullish barometer for the USDJPY.  It also has been a level that traders have been leaning against on the dips EVEN THOUGH it is at progressively at higher levels. That is the bullish. The not so bullish you is the price action this week has run into some formidable resistance above that has been able to put a lid on the rallies too.  More specifically, the 100 day MA currently at 136.79 and the 200 day MA currently at 137.28 are key resistance targets. During trading yesterday, the price did move above the 100 day MA, on two separate occasions only to find willing sellers.  The 200 day MA was not threatened. With the price currently trading at 136.277, the pair sits between the 100 day MA above at 136.79 and the 200 hour MA below at 135.746. In between THOSE level sits the 100 hour MA at 136.328. That 100 hour MA will be an interim barometer. So... the battle goes on.  Traders will be looking for the next shove. On the top side it would be to get above the 100 day moving average and then the 200 day moving average (see blue and green lines on the chart below). ON the downside, the importance of holding the 200 hour moving average is important. Will blow it and stay below would open the door for more downside corrective probing in the pair. PS the low to high trading range for the USDJPY this week is only 184 pips. That is the lowest trading range since 171 pips back in September, and the fourth lowest trading range over the last year. The market is non-trending, helped by the the technical levels in play.

In doing so, the Cable pair fails to extend the previous day’s upside break of the one-month-old descending resistance line, now support around 1.2020. However, the Cable price is yet to drop back below the resistance-turned-support and the MACD signals are bullish too, which in turn keeps the GBP/USD buyers hopeful amid steady RSI. Adding strength to the upside bias is the quote’s successful trading beyond the 200-DMA. In addition to the 200-DMA support of around 1.1900, an upward-sloping trend line from early January, close to 1.1940 at the latest, also acts as the short-term key support for the GBP/USD pair. In a case where the GBP/USD remains bearish past 1.1900, lows marked during January 2023 and late November 2022, respectively near 1.1840 and 1.1760, will be in focus. On the flip side, a daily closing beyond the 50-DMA hurdle surrounding 1.2140 could quickly propel the Cable pair toward the mid-February swing high surrounding 1.2270. It’s worth noting, however, that the GBP/USD pair’s successful trading above 1.2270 enables the buyers to aim for the 2.5-month-old horizontal resistance area nearing 1.2445-50.

In doing so, theAussiepair portrays the failure to cross the 50-bar Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Even so, the bullish MACD signals and the RSI (14) rebound keeps the AUD/USD buyers hopeful unless the quote breaks a three-day-old support line, around 0.6720. Following that, the monthly low near the 0.6700 round figure and the January 2023 low of 0.6687 can act as extra checks for the Aussie pair sellers before giving them control. Should the AUD/USD bears keep the reins past 0.6687, the last December’s bottom surrounding 0.6630 may gain the market’s attention. On the contrary, recovery moves need to cross the 50-EMA hurdle near 0.6775 to convince intraday buyers of the AUD/UDS pair. However, a convergence of the 100-EMA and a downward-sloping resistance line from early February, around 0.6820-25 by the press time, appears a tough nut to crack for the pair buyers. In a case where the AUD/USD bulls manage to keep the driver’s seat past 0.6825, the odds of witnessing a run-up toward the mid-February high of near 0.7030 can’t be ruled out.

Adding filters to the latest market moves could be the downbeat US Treasury yields, extending the previous week’s pullback from a multi-month high, as well as the minor losses of the USstockfutures. That said, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has urged the Government to stop “overselling” its new post-Brexit deal on Northern Ireland and focus on providing clarity on its detail. The same shows the DUP’s dislike for the initial details of the EU-UK deal on the Northern Ireland Protocol (NIP) and raises challenges for the smooth passage of the key Brexit developments in the UK Parliament. To avoid any hardships, the British government is bracing to provide more details on how Northern Irish lawmakers can potentially veto new European Union laws. ""Just to make sure that we get this exactly right, in the next few days, we're going to codify this,"" UK’s EU Minister Chris Heaton-Harris told BBC Radio Ulster, referring to the Stormont brake, per Reuters. Elsewhere, mixed headlines from China and a cautious mood ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell’s half-yearly Testimony, as well as the US employment report for February, seem to weigh on the GBP/USD price amid a sluggish start. Furthermore, the mixed performance of the US Treasury bond yield and the US stock futures also challenge the momentum traders even as the prices print mild losses. While portraying the mood, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields rose to the highest levels since November 2022 before easing to 3.95% at the latest. That said, Wall Street closed with gains but S&P 500 Futures remain indecisive, reversing the early-day losses, by the press time. Moving on, headlines surrounding Brexit and the second-tier UK data may entertain GBP/USD traders but major attention will be given to how Fed’s Powell could push back the policy pivot concerns. Also important will be to watch Friday’s monthly UK data dump for January and the USNonfarm Payrollsfor February. Given the recently downbeat US statistics, any more weakness in the headline figures could put a floor under the Cable price. Technical analysis A clear downside break of the one-month-old previous resistance line, now support around 1.2020, becomes necessary for the intraday sellers. Even so, the 1.2000 psychological magnet and the 200-DMA support of around 1.1900 could challenge the GBP/USD pair’s further downside.

2024-04-16,USDJPY,Negative,USDJPY traces sluggish yields below 13600 Fed’s Powell BoJ’s Kuroda in the spotlight,Anil Panchal,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/usd-jpy-traces-sluggish-yields-below-13600-feds-powell-bojs-kuroda-in-the-spotlight-202303060249,FX Street,"USD/JPY retreats to 135.80 as it reverses the bounce off intraday low amid a sluggish start to the key week. The Yen pair trader’s cautious mood ahead of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) monetary policy meeting and Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell’s half-yearly Testimony appears to be the key filters for the Yen pair. Also challenging the quote’s moves could be the latest inaction of the US Treasury bond yields, as well as the mixed signals from China. The US benchmark bond coupon, namely the 10-year Treasury bond yields, rose to the highest levels since November 2022 in the last week before easing to 3.95% by the end of Friday, making rounds to the same level at the latest. More importantly, the US two-year bond coupons rose to the highest levels last seen in 2008 before retreating to 4.85% by the press time. It’s worth noting that the receding optimism about the Fed’s hawkish moves, mixed US data, and the Fed policymakers’ failure to impress USD/JPY bulls seem to weigh on the yields of late. Furthermore, China’s expectations of modest growth for 2023 and the Sino-American tension are extra filters for traders. During the last week, the US ISM Services PMI for February came in as 55.1 versus 54.5 market expectations and 55.2 market forecasts. Previously in that week, the US Durable Goods Orders for January eased while the Conference Board’s (CB) Consumer Confidence also flashed mostly downbeat details. With this, Federal Reserve Bank ofAtlanta President Raphael Bosticrenewed concerns about the Fed’s policy pivot as the decision-maker said, “The central bank could be in a position to pause the current tightening cycle by mid to late summer.” However, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said during the weekend that if data on inflation and the labor market continues to come in hotter than expected, interest rates will need to go higher, and stay there longer, than Fed policymakers projected in December, as reported by Reuters. On the same line, US Federal Reserve published a semi-annual Monetary Policy Report on Friday: ""Ongoing increases in the Fed funds rate target are necessary.” The report also stated that the Fed is committed to reducing inflation to 2%. It’s worth noting that the BoJ officials and incoming board members have recently defended the Japanese central bank’s ultra-easy monetary policy, which puts a floor under the USD/JPY prices. Further, expectations that BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may play its last ball with all strength also keep the yen pair buyers hopeful despite the latest weakness in the quote. On the other hand, Fed’s Powell may have a tough time convincing markets amid pivot talks and mixed data. Even if he does, the USNonfarm Payrolls(NFP) will be watched closely for clear directions. Technical analysis The latest U-turn from the 100-DMA and the downside break of the one-month-old previous support line keep USD/JPY sellers hopeful.

It’s worth noting that the Aussie pair marked the first weekly gain in three amid broadUS Dollarweakness in the last week. That said, the recent positive headlines from China, after an initial disappointment, seem to help the Aussie pair of late. After showing an initial disappointment from China’s downbeat growth forecasts, following the softer economic figures in decades, the AUD/USD pair buyers cheer the latest headlines from the National Development and Reform Commission of the People's Republic of China (NDRC). “Will further release the potential for consumption,” said NDRC while also adding that China's economy steadily improving, per Reuters. Meanwhile, softer prints of Australia’s TD Securities Inflation for February, 6.3% YoY versus 6.4% prior, seemed to have also probed theAussiepair buyers earlier in the day. During the weekend, headlines from China’s annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC) appeared grim and weighed on the risk profile early Monday. The NPC expected a modest growth of 5.0%, versus market expectations of 6.0%, for the current year. Apart from the softerGross Domestic Product(GDP) expectations, geopolitical concerns were also discussed and the same challenged AUD/USD buyers. “China should promote the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and advance the process of China's ""peaceful reunification"", but also take resolute steps to oppose Taiwan independence,” said outgoing China Premier Li Keqiang. Looking further back, softer prints of the US data and mixed Fed talks joined the US Treasury bond yields’ retreat from the multi-month high to recall the AUD/USD buyers, following a two-week losing streak. US ISM Services PMI for February came in as 55.1 versus 54.5 market expectations and 55.2 market forecasts. Previously in that week, the US Durable Goods Orders for January eased while the Conference Board’s (CB) Consumer Confidence also flashed mostly downbeat details. Talking about the Fed talks, Federal Reserve Bank ofAtlanta President Raphael Bosticrenewed concerns about the Fed’s policy pivot as the decision-maker said, “The central bank could be in a position to pause the current tightening cycle by mid to late summer.”  However, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said during the weekend that if data on inflation and the labor market continues to come in hotter than expected, interest rates will need to go higher, and stay there longer, than Fed policymakers projected in December, as reported by Reuters. On the same line, US Federal Reserve published a semi-annual Monetary Policy Report on Friday wherein it clearly said, “Ongoing increases in the Fed funds rate target are necessary.” The report also stated that the Fed is strongly committed to getting inflation back to 2%. Amid these plays, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields, rose to the highest levels since November 2022 in the last week before easing to 3.95% by the end of Friday, making rounds to the same level at the latest. More importantly, the US two-year bond coupons rose to the highest levels last seen in 2008 before retreating to 4.85% by the press time. That said, the S&P 500 Futures print mild gains, tracking Wall Street’s moves amid a light sluggish start to the key week. Looking ahead, the money policy meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), China’s inflation data and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Testimony will be important to watch for the AUD/USD pair traders ahead of Friday’s US jobs report for February. Given the RBA’s receding hawkish bias, coupled with the fresh chatters surrounding Fed’s policy pivot, the AUD/USD pair may witness further grinding amid a lack of clear directions.

The major currency pair recovered from a two-month low in the last week on broadUS Dollarweakness, as well as the hawkish concerns about the European Central Bank (ECB). However, the cautious mood ahead of the top-tier catalysts from the US and Europe seems to test the momentum traders of late. Also read:EUR/USD grinds lower towards 1.0600 ahead of Eurozone Retail Sales, focus on Fed Chair Powell, US NFP That said, a one-month-old descending resistance line, near 1.0660 by the press time, acts as an extra filter towards the north, apart from the immediate 100-SMA hurdle of 1.0650. It’s worth noting that the EUR/USD pair’s run-up beyond the 1.0650 hurdle isn’t an open invitation for the quote’s rally as the 200-SMA and a two-month-long horizontal resistance area could check the pair’s further upside, respectively near 1.0745 and 1.0760-65. Shouldthe EUR/USD pairportray another defeat from the key SMA hurdle, a one-week-old ascending support line near 1.0600 will be crucial to watch as it holds the gate for the pair’s slump toward early 2023 low near 1.0480. Adding strength to the 1.0480 support is November 2022’s top. In a case where EUR/USD drops below 1.0480, the late November low near 1.0290 and the monthly bottom of 1.0222 will be in focus.

The pair, however, recovers a few pips from the daily low and trades just above mid-135.00s during the early European session, down around 0.20% for the day. TheUS Dollarkicks off the new week on a subdued note amid a modest downtick in the US Treasury bond yields and turns out to be a key factor weighing on the USD/JPY pair lower. Apart from this, looming recession risks seem to benefit the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and contribute to the offered tone surrounding the major. Worries about a deeper global economic downturn resurfaced after China set a lower-than-expected target for economic growth andforecastthat the economy would expand by 5% in 2023. The downside for the USD/JPY pair, meanwhile, seems cushioned amid the divergent Bank of Japan-Federal Reserve monetary policy outlook. In fact,  the incoming BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda stressed the need to maintain the ultra-loose policy to support the fragile economy and said last week that the central bank isn't seeking a quick move away from a decade of massive easing. In contrast, the US central bank is universally expected to stick to its hawkish stance and keep rates higher for longer to tame high inflation. The incoming US macro data indicated that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped and pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs. Adding to this, a slew of FOMC members backed the case for higher rate hikes and opened the door for a 50 bps lift-off at the March policy meeting.  This should act as a tailwind for the US bond yields and favours the USD bulls, which supports prospects for the emergence of dip-buying around the USD/JPY and warrants caution for bears. Traders might also prefer to move to the sidelines ahead of this week's key event/data risks, starting with Fed Chair Jerome Powell's semi-annual congressional testimony on Tuesday and Wednesday. Investors will look for fresh clues about the Fed's future rate-hike path, which will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics.

Chinese government officials over the weekend set a lower-than-expected target of 5% GDP growth for the current year and undermined expectations of a strong recovery in the world's second-largest economy. This leads to a modest gap-down opening for the China-proxy Australian Dollar, though a softer tone surrounding theUS Dollarassists the AUD/USD pair to attract some buying around the 0.6740 region. A modest downtick in the US Treasury bond yields is seen as a key factor that keeps the USD bulls on the defensive on Monday. That said, the prospects for a further policy tightening by the Federal Reserve act as a tailwind for the US bond yields and the Greenback, which, in turn, seems to cap the upside for the AUD/USD pair.

EUR/USD up on dollar weakness EUR/USD looks to extend Friday’s marked advance north of 1.0600 the figure on Monday amidst some indecision surrounding the greenback and the generalized downside pressure in US and German yields. Indeed, renewed speculation around a potential pivot in the Fed’s tightening cycle appears to have removed some strength from the dollar in the last couple of sessions, morphing in turn to fresh oxygen for the risk complex. In the domestic calendar, the Construction PMI in Germany improved to 48.6 in February, while the Investor Confidence in the broader Euroland measured by the Sentix Index unexpectedly worsened to -11.1 for the current month. Later in the NA session, Factory Orders will be the only release of note seconded by short-term bill auctions. What to look for around EUR EUR/USD extends the ongoing recovery past the 1.0600 mark amidst the continuation of the selling mood around the dollar. In the meantime, price action around the European currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the potential next moves from the ECB after the bank has already anticipated another 50 bps rate raise at the March event. Back to the euro area, recession concerns now appear to have dwindled, which at the same time remain an important driver sustaining the ongoing recovery in the single currency as well as the hawkish narrative from the ECB. Key events in the euro area this week: Germany Construction PMI, EMU Sentix Index, Retail Sales (Monday) – GermanyRetail Sales, EMU Advanced Q4 GDP Growth Rate, ECB Lagarde (Wednesday) – Germany Final Inflation Rate, ECB Lagarde (Friday). Eminent issues on the back boiler: Continuation of the ECB hiking cycle amidst dwindling bets for a recession in the region and still elevated inflation. Impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the growth prospects and inflationoutlookin the region. Risks of inflation becoming entrenched.

The RBA is set to deliver another 25 basis points rate hike in March, lifting the Official Cash Rate (OCR) from 3.35% to 3.60%. The focus will be on the March statement for any changes in the central bank’s language, with regard to the wage and rate hikeoutlook. ING “We expect that the upcoming RBA meeting is going to be much more interesting than has been the case recently. The RBA will want to see confirmation of a downward trend in inflation, not just a reversal of seasonal spikes to even consider pausing its current 25 bps per meeting tightening strategy. The softer-than-expected 4Q22 GDP number was encouraging but we would need to see confirmation from other data to conclude that a slowdown is underway, and of a sufficient magnitude to see inflation fall back within the RBA’s 2-3% target range.” ANZ “While the weak wages resultraisesthe risk the RBA may feel able to pause in its tightening cycle earlier than we currently think, we still expect another 25 bps hike. The nascent recovery in housing prices would suggest that rate hikes have not yet quelled demand enough to be confident that inflation will move back into the target band in a reasonable time frame. We’ll be watching the post-meeting statement for the RBA’s take on the wages data. The Board’s interpretation of the wages data will give us a guide on what might be ahead.” Westpac “We expect the Board will decide to lift the cash rate by a further 0.25% from 3.35% to 3.6%. We would be very surprised if the Board decided to pause in March. A further hike in April, which is Westpac’s view, seems the logical extension of the February statement. Any policy change to take the recent data into account should be contemplated for May.” Standard Chartered “We expect a 25 bps hike to 3.60%. We recently revised the terminal rate to 4.10% from 3.50% previously. Specifically, we expect the central bank to hike by 25 bps each in March, April and May. Trimmed mean CPI inflation eased to 1.7% QoQ in Q4-2022 from 1.9% QoQ in Q3 – still far too high. Inflation pressures are also still very broad – we estimate that 84% of items in the CPI basket are rising by more than 3% YoY. These factors raise risks of a 50 bps hike in March.” TDS “The focus will be on whether the RBA softens its language in light of recent weaker data. On the back of the widening breadth and persistence of inflation, the cash rate in Australia remaining below comparable G10 economies, and the Australian economy more likely to benefit from China's reopening, we expect the RBA to push on with hikes in Apr and May.” Nomura “We expect the RBA governor’s press release to: i) announce a 25 bps hike; ii) contain mixed macro comments; and iii) provide less hawkish forward guidance.” SocGen “We believe that recent signs in the macroeconomic data, such as the decline in inflation, the rebound in unemployment rate, relatively lukewarm wages growth and the confirmation of consumption slowdown all support a 25 bps hike in March. They also support our base scenario of a terminal policy rate at 3.85%, despite the financial market’s more hawkish expectation on US Fed policy.” Citibank “We expect RBA to increase the cash rate by 25 bps to 3.60%. This would be the highest since May 2012 and take monetary policy further into restrictive territory. Citi’s mid-point estimate of neutral is ~ 2.85%.” Wells Fargo “We expect the RBA to raise its policy rate by 25 bps to 3.60%, while we also expect a final 25 bps rate hike to 3.85% in April. There could also be interest in this meeting as to whether theRBAhints at any possibility that rate hikes might continue beyond April as well.”",Negative,-0.3,137588.0,united states,47.4,50.5,69.7,0.055,0.034,0.039,0.037,0.031,dxy,103.36,104.26,100.62,101.33,3.23887,255.313,19697.3,29016.714,5.31,4.0,105.41000366210938,105.4499969482422,105.02999877929688,105.13999938964844

A light calendar in the United Kingdom (UK) would keep traders focused on the busiest docket in the United States (US). At the time of writing, the GBP/USD is trading at 1.2019. The GBP/USD at the mercy of US economic data As abovementioned, risk sentiment is a mixed bag. The UK economic calendar will reveal theGross Domestic Product(GDP) on Friday, ahead of the Bank of England’s (BoE) March 23 meeting. The US economic docket will feature Factory Orders for January, foreseen to fall to -1.8%, below the prior’s month reading of 1.8%. The greenback (USD) is printing losses, capping the GBP/USD’s fall below the 1.2000 figure. The USDollar Index(DXY), a gauge of the buck’s value vs. a basket of six currencies, extended its losses, by 0.14%, at 104.380. Meanwhile, US Treasury bond yields, which underpinned the USD last week’s price action, are down, with the 10-year benchmark note rate below 4%, at 3.950%. The week could be volatile due to US Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell’s appearance at the US Congress on March 7 and 8. Analysts expect Powell to maintain a hawkish stance, echoing some of his colleague’s tone. He’s expected to reiterate that interest rates must go higher for longer if the US economy continues to print solid data. Following astonishing January data, the USNonfarm Payrollsfigures are awaited on Friday. Market participants estimate the US economy added 200K jobs to the economy. Any figures below expectations would weigh on the USD, meaning the GBP/USD could appreciate. On the flip side, stronger data would warrant further tightening by the Fed. GBP/USD Technical levels The GBP/USD daily chart suggests that the pair is bottoming around 1.2000. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in bearish territory, with a downward slope, meaning that sellers are in control. The Rate of Change (RoC) suggests the sellers are losing momentum. Therefore mixed signals within oscillators suggest the GBP/USD pair is sideways. For a bullish continuation, the GBP/USD must clear the 200-day EMA at 1.2120. On the bearish front, the GBP/USD must break below the 100-day EMA at 1.2033 and beneath 1.2000 to pave the way for further losses.

Move above and they look for the higher targets. Traders hope the 100/200 hour MA prove some momentum in the direction of the break, but ultimately, the price will need to make a break below 1.1914, or above the 1.21469 to get the pair out of the quagmire. Until then, the interim levels between those extremes will be explored, tested, broken or not broken. So follow the targets. Try to trade near them.

Key survey data suggest tightness in the UK labour market is abating and theGross Domestic Productis up next for review. Analysts at TD Securities argued that it is set to bounce back sharply as many of the special factors that weighed on the December data will reverse. ''A downtick in strike action, a jump in hospital visits, the resumption of the Premier League after the end of the World Cup, and a bounce-back in school attendance likely drove a 0.7% m/m increase in services output. Underlying growth dynamics likely remained weak though,'' the analysts argued. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday will be a driver for the US Dollar as will the jobs report. The analysts at Danske Bank are expecting growth to moderate to 220k after the effects of warm weather and heavy seasonal adjustments in January faded.

In doing so, theAussiepair cheers positives from the Australian Exports and Imports while paying a little heed to the downbeat trade surplus. It’s worth noting that the quote remains dicey so far during the day as traders await the key Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announcements, as well as the key Testimony from Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell. Australia’s January monthly Trade Balance came in 11,688M versus 12,500M market forecasts and 12,237M previous readings. The details suggest that the Exports reversed the previous -1.0% with 1.0% growth while Imports rose 5.0% from 1.0% previous readings. In addition to the upbeat Exports and Imports, comments from Aussie Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also seemed to have teased the AUD/USD buyers after a downbeat start to the key week. That said, Australia PM Albanese said earlier in the day, “I believe Australia can avoid a recession.” The policymaker also said that the relationship with China has improved. Elsewhere, dicey markets ahead of the keyRBAand Fed Chair Powell’s announcements join the fears emanating from the likely Sino-American tension, due to the anticipated meeting of the US and Taiwanese Officials, which seem to weigh on the AUD/USD pair. It should be observed that softer prints of the second-tier US data, including ISM PMIs, Consumer Confidence and Durable Goods Orders joined comments from AtlantaFed President Raphael Bosticto renew concerns about the policy pivot and weighed on the DXY in the last week, which in turn favored the AUD/USD bulls.

The major pair cheered the broad US Dollar weakness in the last two days to poke the highest levels in a fortnight. However, the cautious mood ahead of this week’s top-tier events seems to challenge the bulls of late. Apart from the broad US Dollar weakness, hawkish comments from the European Central Bank (ECB) officials also allowedthe EUR/USD pairto remain firmer. It’s worth noting that softer data at home contrasts with an improvement in the US statistics to probe the pair’s upside momentum and challenge the immediate moves. That said, USDollar Index(DXY) prints mild gains around 104.40 to snap a two-day downtrend. In doing so, the greenback’s gauge versus the six major currencies traces the recent rebound in the US Treasury bond yields. US 10-year Treasury bond yields initially dropped to a one-week low of 3.897% on Monday before ending the day with mild gains near 3.96%, staying around the same level by the press time. On the same line, the two-year counterpart ended Monday’s North American trading session with 0.60% intraday gains at 4.88%, mostly unchanged at the latest. Talking about the data, theEurozoneSentix Investor Confidence index worsens to -11.1 in March from -8.0 in February and -8.6 expected. Further, the Current Situation in the Eurozone improved to -9.3 during the stated month, from -10.0 prior, whereas the Expectations Index tumbled to -13.0 from -6.0 in February. EurozoneRetail Salesgrew by 0.3% MoM in February versus 1.0% expected and -1.6% prior while the YoY figures suggest the bloc’sRetail Salesarrived at -2.3% in February versus -2.8% seen in January and the 1.9% consensusforecast, per the official figures released by Eurostat showed on Monday. On the other hand, US Factory Orders improved to -1.6% MoM in January versus -1.8% expected and -1.7% prior. It should be observed thatECB President Lagardetold Spanish media group Vocento, per Reuters, “Underlying inflation in the Eurozone will stay high in the near term so a 50 basis point European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate increase later this month is increasingly certain.” However, when asked about a possible 50 basis points (bps) rate hike in March, European Central Bank (ECB) policymaker Centeno said that “the decision must be based on data.” Adding that the “interest rates have risen too fast.” Elsewhere, the fears emanating from the likely Sino-American tension, due to the anticipated meeting of the US and Taiwanese Officials, join recent doubts about the Fed’s hawkish move to challenge the traders ahead of the key event. Amid these plays, Wall Street closed mixed and the S&P 500 Futures also struggle for clear directions. Moving ahead, Fed Chair Powell’s testimony will be crucial to watch for the EUR/USD pair traders. Fed’s Powell appears before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and should defend the US central bank’s hawkish bias to recall the bears. Technical analysis Although the EUR/USD pair aptly portrays a clear bounce off the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), around 1.0540 by the press time, the pair’s upside moves appear elusive unless crossing the mid-January swing low surrounding 1.0766.

In doing so, the Yen pair justifies the previous day’s upside break of a three-day-old resistance line, now support near 135.90. Apart from the trend line breakout, the bullish MACD signals also keep the USD/JPY buyers hopeful as they approach the 100-Hour Moving Average (HMA) hurdle of 136.20. Following that, the support-turned-resistance line from February, near 136.50 by the press time, could challenge the USD/JPY pair’s further advances. It’s worth noting that there are multiple levels around 136.60 and 137.00, marked during late February and early March, which can probe the USD/JPY bulls before directing them to the final defense of the bears, namely the previous weekly top of 137.10. In a case where the Yen pair remains firmer past 137.10, the odds of witnessing a run-up toward the December 2022 peak of 138.17, can’t be ruled out. Meanwhile, pullback moves remain elusive unless theUSD/JPY pairremains beyond the previous resistance line from last Thursday, close to 135.90. In a case where the Yen pair drops below 135.90, it can drop to a one-week-old ascending trend line near 135.40 will be in focus. Overall, USD/JPY is likely to remain firmer but the pair’s further upside needs validation from 136.50.

Economists surveyed by Reuters revealed that the RBA would announce its fifth straight quarter-point interest rate hike on Tuesday, followed by one more lift next quarter, before pausing until next year. AUD/USD reaction In a knee-jerk reaction to the RBA decision, the AUD/USD pair dropped nearly 30 pips toward 0.6700. At the time of writing, the Aussie is down 0.06% on the day, trading at 0.6720.

Adding strength to the Aussie pair’s pullback could be the geopolitical concerns surrounding the US-China ties. RBA matches market forecasts of lifting the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.60%. The Aussie central bank even said that the RBA expects further monetary tightening will be needed. However, fears of a lack of upside room for the Official Cash Rate (OCR) and an absence of hawkish surprise seem to have weighed on the AUD/USD price. On the same line could be the RBA Statement saying that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicator hints at the inflation peak.

Though, fears of fresh US-China tussles, due to the likely meeting between the officials from the US and Taiwan, as well as amid Beijing’s criticism of Washington’s cold war strategies, seem to challenge the AUD/USD pair of late due to its risk-barometer status.

The major currency pair has been strengthened as investors’risk appetitehas improved. Investors have shrugged off recession risks associated with the United States economy due to higher rates from the Federal Reserve (Fed). The USDollar Index(DXY) looks vulnerable above the 104.20 support. The downside in the USD Index seems favored amid a decline in safe-haven’s appeal. S&P500 futures have added decent gains in the Asian session after Monday’s sideways auction, portraying positivemarket sentiment. An improved risk appetite has supported demand for US government bonds. This has resulted in a decline in the 10-year US Treasury yields to 3.96%. The Euro has been provided significant bids as investors are expecting more rate hikes from the European Central Bank (ECB) amid renewed fears of higher inflation in Eurozone. Fed Powell’s testimony to provide interest rate guidance Resilience observed in the United States through January’s consumer spending indicated that the Federal Reserve will continue hiking rates. Achieving price stability is the foremost agenda of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell and for that more rates are highly required to tame sticky inflation. However, modest dovish commentary from Federal Reserve (Fed) Governor Christopher Waller has trimmed fears of hawkish guidance. Fed Waller cited February’s inflation recovery as a one-time blip and the price pressures will resume their downtrend from next month. Meanwhile, analysts at MUFG said “They don’t expect Fed Chair Jerome Powell to endorse that scale of further tightening” when the Fed chief takes to Capitol Hill to deliver his semi-annual testimony before Congress. Analysts further added that Fed Powell is more likely to “wait to assess further data in the coming months to see if the strength in activity and inflation is sustained before strongly committing to more rate hikes.” US labor market to lay ground for further Fed moves A power-pack action is expected from the US Dollarthis weekas investors will shift their focus to the Employment data after Federal Reserve Powell’s testimony. On Wednesday, the United States Automatic Data Processing (ADP) will report the Employment Change data. According to the estimates, the US economy has added fresh 195K payrolls in February, higher than the former release of 105K. Later this week, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics will report theNonfarm Payrolls(NFP) and the Unemployment Rate data. Apart from that, Labor cost index data will be in the spotlight as higher earnings will propel consumer spending ahead. This could force the Fed to stretch its restrictive policy measures further. And, the US Dollar bulls will be in the beast mode. European Central Bank’s Centeno sounds contrary to renewed inflation fears Less-than-anticipated fall in the Eurozone’s Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) and standalone recovery in German, Spain, and France inflation have renewed the risk of inflationary pressures. It seems that the impact of lower energy prices is fading away andEurozonecould fall into an inflation spiral ahead. Citing inflation as ‘too high’, European Central Bank President ChristineLagardehas already announced that the central bank will push rates further by 50 bps in its March monetary policy meeting. However, ECB policymaker Mario Centeno looks a little diverged from the provided plan. When asked about a possible 50 basis points (bps) rate hike in March, European Central Bank (ECB) policymaker Centeno said that “the decision must be based on data.” Adding that the “interest rates have risen too fast.” EUR/USD technical outlook  EUR/USD is marching towards the supply zone placed in a range of 1.0698-1.0705 on an hourly scale. The major currency pair is expected to recapture the same considering the strength in the upside momentum. A bull cross, represented by the 20-and 50-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 1.0674 and 1.0654 respectively, add to the upside filters. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is oscillating in the bullish range of 60.00-80.00, which indicates that the upside momentum is already active.

In doing so, the Cable pair buyers poke the top line of a three-day-old ascending triangle. It’s worth noting, however, that the quote’s successful trading above the 200-Hour Moving Average (HMA) joins the bullish signals from the MACDindicatorsto keep the GBP/USD buyers hopeful. As a result, an upside break of the immediate horizontal resistance near 1.2050, forming part of the aforementioned triangle, becomes imminent. Following that, the last Wednesday’s swing high near 1.2090 and 1.2100 could test the GBP/USD buyers before directing them to the two-week-old horizontal resistance area surrounding 1.2145-50. On the contrary, a downside break of the stated triangle’s lower line, near 1.2025 by the press time, needs validation from the 200-HMA level of 1.2015 to convince GBP/USD bears. Even so, the 1.2000 psychological magnet and 1.1960 level may test the Cable pair seller before directing them to a broad support zone between 1.1915 and 1.1930, stretched from February 17. In a case where the GBP/USD sellers conquer the 1.1915 support, the 1.1900 round figure may act as an extra filter towards the south.

In theinterest rate decision, RBAGovernor Philip Lowepushed the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points (bps) consecutively for the fifth time to 3.60% to sharpen monetary tools in the battle against persistent Australian inflation. RBA’s Lowe cited “The monthly CPI indicator suggests that inflation has peaked in Australia,” as reported by Reuters. Further downside in the USDollar Index(DXY) looks likely amid the absence of recovery signs after printing a fresh day low near 104.16. S&P500 futures have reported more gains, indicating that investors have underpinned the risk-appetite theme. AUD/USD is showing a tad longer consolidation in the range of 0.6700-0.6784 on an hourly scale. The 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.6737 is acting as a major barricade for the Australian Dollar. A slippage by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) in the bearish range of 20.00-40.00 is indicating a downside momentum ahead. A downside move below March 01 low around 0.6700 will drag the Aussie toward December 07 low at 0.6669 and December 20 low at 0.6629. In an alternate scenario, a confident break above March 01 high at 0.6784 will send the asset toward the round-level resistance at 0.6800 followed by February 06 low at 0.6855.

The USDollar Index(DXY) is demonstrating signs of recovery after printing a day low at 104.16. The USD Index bulls could retreat amid therisk appetitetheme, underpinned by the market participants. An upbeat market mood has also improved demand for US government bonds and has pushed the 10-year US Treasury yields below 3.96%. Two-day Fed Powell’s testimony before Congress will provide meaningful cues. The street is having mixed responses toward commentary as one school of thought expects a hawkish commentary amid higher inflationary pressures while the other school of thought sees a neutral stance as many things bank upon February’s data. Going ahead, if United States inflation continues to persist, the Unemployment Rate remains at lower levels, and consumer spending remains resilient, Fed Powell would have no other option than to push rates higher.

Spot prices retreat to the lower end of the daily range, around the 1.2020-1.2015 region during the first half of the European session and remain at the mercy of the US Dollar price dynamics. A generally positive tone around the equity markets, along with retreating US Treasury bond yields, initially weighed on the safe-haven Greenback and offered some support to the GBP/USD pair. That said, looming recession risks continue to keep a lid on any optimistic move in the markets. Apart from this, the prospects for further policy tightening by the Federal Reserve act as a tailwind for the US bond yields, which, in turn, help limit the downside for the USD and cap the upside for the major, at least for the time being. Investors seem convinced that the US central bank will stick to its hawkish stance and keep interestrateshigher for longer in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. The bets were reaffirmed by the incoming US macro data, which indicated that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped and pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs. Moreover, a slew of FOMC policymakers recently backed the case for higher rate hikes and opened the door for a 50 bps lift-off at the March meeting. Hence, the market focus will remain glued toFedChair Jerome Powell's semi-annual congressional testimony on Tuesday and Wednesday. Investors will look for clues about the Fed's future rate-hike path, which will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics and provide a fresh directional impetus to the GBP/USD pair. In the meantime, anxiety over the new UK-EUBrexitdeal on the Northern Ireland Protocol further seems to hold back the bullish traders from placing fresh bets around the major. The price action, meanwhile, indicates that an additional rate hike by theBank of England(BoE) is already fully priced in the markets. Moreover, some analysts still hope that the UK central bank would pause the current tightening cycle. This, in turn, suggests that the path of least resistance for the GBP/USD pair is to the downside and any meaningful upside could be seen as a selling opportunity.

The pair now seems to have found acceptance below the 0.6700 round-figure mark and seems vulnerable to prolonging its downward trajectory witnessed over the past month or so. The Australian Dollar weakens across the board in reaction to the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) signal that a pause in its 10-month rate-hiking cycle is on the way. The RBA earlier this Tuesday raised its overnight cash rate as expected by 25 bps to 3.6%, or the highest since June 2012. In the accompanying policy statement, the RBA changed a reference from “further increases in rates” to “further tightening of monetary policy” would be needed and boosted expectations for an eventual pause in the policy tightening. Adding to this, RBAGovernor Philip Lowewarned that the path to achieving a soft landing for the Australian economy remains a narrow one and fueled worries that the economy could suffer a recession over the next 24 months. This, along with the disappointing release of Australia's trade balance data, is seen weighing on the domestic currency and dragging the AUD/USD pair lower for the second successive day. Bulls, meanwhile, fail to gain any respite and seem rather unimpressed by a subdued US Dollar demand. A generally positive tone around the equity markets seems to undermine the safe-haven Greenback, though does little to benefit the risk-sensitive Aussie or lend any support to the AUD/USD pair. The latest leg down, meanwhile, confirms a fresh breakdown through over a one-week-old trading range support. Apart from this, growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will stick to its hawkish stance for longer favours the USD bulls and suggests that the path of least resistance for spot prices is to the downside. Traders, however, might refrain from placing aggressive bets and prefer to wait forFedChair Jerome Powell's semi-annual congressional testimony.

The pair slides back below the 1.2000 psychological mark in the last hour and is pressured by the emergence of fresh US Dollar buying. Growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve will stick to its hawkish stance and keep interestrateshigher for longer turn out to be a key factor that continues to act as a tailwind for the USD. Apart from this, looming recession risks further seem to benefit the Greenback's relative safe-haven status amid some repositioning trade ahead ofFedChair Jerome Powell's semi-annual testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. Looking at the broader picture, the two-way price moves witnessed over the past four weeks or so constitute the formation of a rectangle on the dailychart. The lower end of the trading band coincides with a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Bearish traders need to wait for a convincing break through the said support, currently pegged around the 1.1910 area, before placing fresh bets. The GBP/USD pair might then turn vulnerable to accelerate the fall towards retesting the YTD low, around the 1.1840 region touched in January. Some follow-through selling will complete a bearish double-top pattern formation near the 1.2445-1.2450 area and pave the way for deeper losses. The downward trajectory could eventually drag spot prices below the 1.1800 mark, towards the 1.1725 support zone. On the flip side, the daily swing high, around the 1.2065 area, now seems to act as an immediate barrier ahead of the 1.2100 mark. Any subsequent move-up could attract fresh sellers and remain capped near the 50-day SMA, around the 1.2135-1.2140 region.

The pair is trading under 1.0600, under pressure as the US Dollar soars across the board. Fed Chair Jerome Powellsaid in his prepared remarks that the central bank is ready to increase the pace of rate hikes. He added that the strength of the economy suggests that the terminal rate will be higher than previously anticipated. ""Long way to go on getting inflation back down, road likely to be bumpy”. Powell is testifying on Tuesday in the US Congress in front of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. He is presenting the “The Semi-Annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress” and will take questions from lawmakers. On Wednesday, he will be back to testify in front of the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services. Jerome Powell Speech Live: All about Fed Chair US Senate testimony Immediately after the release, the US Dollar jumped across the board and US yields rocketed. The US 10-year yield rose from 3.92% reaching levels above 4%, while the 2-year hit 4.97%, the highest since 2007. EUR/USDdropped from near 1.0650 to as low as 1.0585, the lowest level since Friday. The next support is seen at 1.0560/65 and below attention would turn to February lows around 1.0530. A recovery above 1.0640 would alleviate the bearish pressure.

AUD is down a whopping 2% on the day after dropping like a stone from 0.6661 US session highs to a low of 0.6591 thus far vs. the US Dollar, the lowest since Nov. 22. AUD/USD's high for the day, however, was up at 0.6747 before markets started to position for possible hawkish rhetoric from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to Congress in US trade. Hawkish rhetoric was what the market's got and stubborn investors holding their bets against the US Dollar were taken to the cleaners. The DXY index, a measure of the US Dollar vs. a basket of currencies, vaulted 105 the figure in a move that started out from 104.43 and kept going until 105.435. The trigger? Reserve Bank of Australia and Federal Reserve divergence In recent trade, Federal Reserve's chair Jerome Powell said that the US central bank will stay the course until the job is done. However, Fed's Powell added that the ultimate level of interestratesis likely to be higher than previously anticipated. Federal Reserve'schairman Jerome Powellalso said that the Fed is prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes if data indicates it is warranted: ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" Federal Reserve's chairman Jerome Powell's comments come after the bank slowed the pace of its tightening to 25 basis points at its last two meetings, following larger hikes last year. Fed funds futures traders have now raised bets that the Fed will hike rates by 50 basis points at its March 21-22 meeting to 56% and a 25 basis points increase is now seen as just a 44% likelihood. Traders are now also pricing for the rate to peak at 5.57% in September and the US Dollar is firmly bid as result. Meanwhile, prior to Federal Reserve's chairman Jerome Powell's hawkish testimony, the Reserve Bank of Australia,RBA, had already sawn the seed for a disparity between the Aussie and US Dollar. AUD was the weakest G10-performing currency due to what was perceived as a move towards a more dovish stance from the RBA at Tuesday's interest rate meeting. The Reserve Bank of Australia's policy-makers hiked interest rates by 25 bps. This was the 10th consecutive tightening but there was a switch up in the language which motivated the market to position for the possibility of a lower peak in rates which in turn weighed on AUD. The RBA has put down the foundations for a forthcoming pause in policy moves. ''In our view, the Fed is set to stick with its hawkish guidance for now suggesting that AUD/USD could remain on the back foot into the middle of the year,'' analysts at Rabobank said. ''That said, on a relative basis, the Australian economy remains fairly well positioned in terms of growth and we expect AUD/USD to pick up some ground in the latter part of the year,'' the analysts argued, adding that this forecast assumes that Fed rates have peaked by then. AUD/USD technical analysis Inprior AUD/USD analysis, it was explained that the downside scenario in a break of AUD/USD support opened risk to a test of the 0.6580s and then the 0.6520s:  AUD/USD update  AD/USD was coiled below the 200 DMA and on the break of support near 0.6700, the bears moved in and ground into 0.6650 orders that made way for a strong impulse down into the 0.6590s that guards the 0.6580s.

According to him, the current pace of hikes could continue into May if underlying inflation does not materially abate. “Once we see a clear, decisive turn in underlying inflation dynamics, I expect the ECB to move to smaller steps.” Knot mentioned that inflation appears to have peaked. The sharp decrease in energy prices seen over the last months could bring down headline inflation even faster than what the ECB is projecting, the policymaker added.

The main words that got the US Dollar going coming from the Fed's chair Powell were, ""the latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" As a consequence, the yield on the US 10-year Treasury note rose to 4% before easing back to 3.96%, remaining marginally below the three-month high of 4.07% touched on March 2nd as investors assessed the pace of future rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. This gave the greenback a boost. The DXY index, a measure of the US Dollar vs. a basket of currencies, vaulted 105 the figure in a move that started out from 104.43 and kept going until 105.435. Meanwhile, the Euro is likely to be hamstrung as Germany may still suffer a technical recession in Q4 2022/Q1 2023. However, analysts at Rabobank argued that ''at least more recent data are indicating resilience in the economy.'' On the other hand, the analysts also said, ‘resilient’ is not ‘strong’ and ''the market is facing these data releases with longer EUR positions than at the end of last year.  This suggests that the hawkish rhetoric of theECBmay struggle to coax the EUR significantly higher particularly given the recent buoyancy of the greenback.'' Of note, inflation remains stubbornly high in the Euro Area which was evident from the February inflation numbers. Officials, such as ECB's Pierre Wunsch indicated that it was not unreasonable to expect ECB to hike to 4%. ECB policymaker Klaas Knot said on Tuesday that the ECB can be expected to keep raising interestratesfor “quite some time” after March. Knot said that the current pace of hikes could continue into May if underlying inflation does not materially abate. “Once we see a clear, decisive turn in underlying inflation dynamics, I expect the ECB to move to smaller steps.” Knot also argued that inflation appears to have peaked.

That is well above the 22 day average of 80 pips (about a month of trading). Technically, the price cracked below both the 200 hour MA and trend line support at 1.0613 soon after the Fed Chair prepared remarks. There was a corrective move higher that retested that MA/underside of the broken trend line. Sellers leaned and pushed the pair lower. The swing area between 1.0576 to 1.0585 was broken as well with more momentum to the downside over the last 2-3 hours. The Low from March 1 was broken more recently. The low from last Monday is the next obvious target at 1.0532. Looking at the five minute chart below, the trend like move is more obvious.  Note the corrective move up to the 200 hour moving average that stalled the correction.  The legs to the downside have been able to stay below the 38.2-50% retracement. It would take a move above 1.0561 – 1.05662 hurt the trend move in the short term. Absent that in the sellers and the trend is still full steam ahead.

His comments increased expectations of a 50 basis points rate hike at the March meeting. Wall Street tumbled and the US Dollar jumped. The DXY hit its highest level since December, rising above 105.50. The US Dollar heads into the Asian session still with impulse, despite overbought readings.

The reason could be linked to the previous day’s RBA statement that already revealed the dovish bias of the Aussie central bank, as well as the bear’s taking of a breather after posting the biggest daily slump in a month. RBA’s Lowe said on Wednesday that it was closer to pausing its aggressive cycle of rate increases as the policy was now in the restrictive territory and there were signs the economy was responding. Also read:RBA’s Lowe: Closer To Pausing On Rate Hikes On Tuesday,RBAmatched market forecasts of lifting the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.60%. The Aussie central bank even said that the RBA expects further monetary tightening will be needed. However, the RBA Statement said that the ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) indicator hints at the inflation peak and seemed to have weighed on the AUD/USD prices upon the announcements. More importantly, hawkish comments from Federal Reserve (Fed)Chairman Jerome Powellin his Semi-Annual Testimony to the US Congress propelled the market’s risk-off mood, as well as the bets of a 50 bp Fed rate hike in March, which in turn drowned the AUD/USD prices. It’s worth noting that the fresh US-China tensions are an extra burden for the risk-barometer pair helping in weighing on the price at the multi-day low. The anticipated meeting of the US and Taiwanese Officials could be cited as the key reason for the same. On the same line, China’s new Foreign Minister, Qin Gang, said that they resolutely oppose all forms of hegemony, cold war mentality. The same indirectly criticizes the US pressure and criticism for the China-Russia ties and escalated the fears of a fresh round of Sino-American tensions. Further, Financial Times (FT) headlines suggesting China’s lowest growth target in decades signals a new era of caution. Amid these plays, Wall Street closed in the red and the US Treasury bond yields were firmer to underpin the US Dollar’s safe-haven demand, which in turn pleased the AUD/USD bears. Looking ahead, the second round of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the US ADP Employment Change, the early signal for Friday’s US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) will be in focus. Also important to watch will be the risk catalysts surrounding China and the movements of the bond market.

That said, the major currency pair snapped a two-day winning streak while posting a U-turn from the 13-day-long horizontal hurdle, as well as pleasing the bears, the previous day. Not only the quote’s U-turn from the short-term key horizontal resistance, around 1.0690-700 but the bearish MACD signals and sustained trading below the 200-SMA also keeps the EUR/USD sellers hopeful. That said, an upward-sloping support line from early January, currently around 1.0540, appears the immediate challenge for the Euro bears to tackle. Following that, the previous monthly low surrounding 1.0530 may act as an intermediate halt during the fall towards the January 2023 bottom of 1.0483. In a case where EUR/USD remains bearish past 1.0483, a late December 2022 trough near 1.0445 could act as an extra downside filter. On the flip side, a clear break of the aforementioned horizontal hurdle near 1.0690-700 becomes necessary to convince the Euro buyers. Even so, the 200-bar Simple Moving Average (SMA), close to 1.0735 by the press time, could act as a validation point for the EUR/USD pair’s further advances.

Fed’s Powell has endorsed moreratesciting inflation as extremely sticky considering the incoming data from the United States economy. Nominal gains have been recorded in the S&P500 futures after an intense sell-off on Tuesday, which could be minor short coverings amid a downbeat market mood. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) settled Tuesday’s session at a three-month high above 105.60 as the risk of recession in theUnited Stateseconomy has soared. The risk aversion theme has pushed the 10-year US Treasury yields above 3.98%. Fed’s Powell in his testimony before Congress unveiled a further roadmap for bringing down the sticky inflation. More interest rates are in pipeline as the current monetary policy is not restrictive enough to achieve price stability. According to the Fed Powell’s testimony, investors should be prepared for more rate hikes than earlier expected as economic indicators are conveying that inflationary pressures are extremely hot. Investors should be aware of the fact that this was the first commentary from Fed’s Powell on interest rates after observing resilience in consumer spending and an upbeat labor market through January’s economic data. Going forward, the release of the US Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Employment Change (Feb) data will be of utmost importance. The economic data is seen higher at 200K vs. the former release of 106K. On the Tokyo front, investors are keenly awaiting the last monetary policy dictation from Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor HaruhikoKuroda, scheduled for Friday. Maintenance of an ultra-loose monetary policy is highly expected as the economy is focused on uplifting the labor cost index.

On the other hand, The Guardian highlights the push the British business leaders use over the UK government to fasten the Brexit practice, which in turn highlights the hopes of an end to the multi-month-old policy deadlock. “Business leaders say frayed relations with the EU are costing the British economy, as suppliers in the bloc grow more cautious about doing business with post-Brexit Britain,” said The Guardian. Elsewhere, Bank of England (BoE) policymaker Catherine Mann said on Tuesday, “I think more needs to be done withrates.” Above all, hawkish comments from Federal Reserve (Fed)Chairman Jerome Powell, as well as the widest negative yield differentials between the 10-year and two-year US Treasury bonds, gain major attention the previous day and drowned the GBP/USD price. It should be noted that Fed’s Powell surprised markets by showing readiness for more rate hikes and bolstered the bets of a 50 bps Fed rate hike in March. The policymaker propelled the “higher for longer” Fed rate expectations and bolstered the US Treasury bond yields while weighing on theequities. Talking about the yields, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields rose 0.15% while closing around 3.97% on Tuesday but the two-year counterpart gained 2.60% on a day when poking the highest levels since 2007, to 5.02% at the latest. With this, the difference between the 10-year and two-year bond coupons marked the widest yield curve inversion in 40 years and portrays the recession, which in turn underpins the US Dollar’s safe-haven demand and weighs on the GBP/USD pair. On a different page, the US removal of testing restrictions on travelers from China contrasts with the US-China tussles over Taiwan and Russia to probe the sentiment. Even so, the S&P 500 Futures remain indecisive while waiting for more signals to track Wall Street’s losses. Looking ahead, a light calendar in the UK may restrict GBP/USD moves after a volatile day. However, Fed Chair Powell’s second round of testimony and the US ADP Employment Change, the early signal for Friday’s US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP), will be observed more closely for clear directions.

In doing so, the Yen pair makes rounds to the 137.40-50 area after rising to the highest levels since mid-December 2022. It should be noted that the Yen pair’s latest run-up could be linked to a successful upside break of the 100-DMA hurdle. However, the 200-DMA level surrounding 137.45-50 restricts the quote’s immediate upside amid the overbought conditions of the RSI (14). Even if the USD/JPY bulls manage to cross the stated key moving average, an upward-sloping resistance line from early February, near 138.35 by the press time, could challenge the pair’s further advances. In a case where the Yen pair bulls ignore the RSI conditions and keep the controls past the aforementioned resistance line, the 50%Fibonacciretracement level of its downturn from October 2022 to January 2023, near 139.60, may act as an additional upside filter. Meanwhile, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level and the 100-DMA, respectively near 136.70 and 136.25, restrict short-termUSD/JPYdownside.

The remarks from RBAGovernor Philip Loweare impacting the Australian Dollar. RBA’s Lowe cited “The central bank is closer to pausing its aggressive cycle of rate increases as the policy is now in the restrictive territory and there are signs the economy was responding.” It seems that the slowdown in January’s monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) has infused confidence in the sentiment of RBA’s Lowe. Apart from that, RBA’s Lowe believes that the reopening of the Chinese economy will positive for the Australian economy.

Meanwhile, S&P500 futures have also resumed their downside journey, portraying that the risk-off mood is strengthening further. A breakdown from the range of 1.1914-1.2150 by the Cable is followed by a large consolidation breakdown formed in the past three months.

It’s worth noting that the Euro pair slumped the most in more than a month the previous day on Federal Reserve (Fed) Jerome Powell’s hawkish rhetoric but a lack of major data/events seem to probe the bears of late, despite keeping them in the driver’s seat during early Wednesday. On Tuesday, Fed Chair Powell surprised traders by showing readiness for more rate hikes and bolstered the bets of a 50 bps Fed rate hike in March during the Semi-Annual Testimony before the US Congress. The policymaker propelled the “higher for longer” Fed rate expectations and bolstered the US Treasury bond yields while weighing on theequities. His comments propelled the yields and the US Dollar. It’s worth noting that the policymakers at theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) tried to defend their hawkish stance during public appearances but could not save the EUR/USD from renewing a two-month low. That said, ECB policymaker and Spanish central bank head Pablo Hernandez de Cos said on Tuesday, “Spain’s GDP forecast is anticipated to be revised up, while CPI is expected to fall.” On a broader front, ECB policymaker Klaas Knot said on Tuesday that the ECB can be expected to keep raising interestratesfor “quite some time” after March. Elsewhere, the US removal of the testing restrictions on travelers from China contrasts with the likely escalation of the Sino-American tensions surrounding Taiwan and Russia to weigh on the sentiment, as well as propel the US Dollar’s haven demand. However, a light calendar in Asia and cautious mood ahead of the key EU and US data/events seem to probe the EUR/USD traders even as the sellers refreshed a multi-day low recently. Amid these plays, the S&P 500 Futures remain indecisive around the 3,988 level after falling the most in two weeks the previous day. On the other hand, the difference between the 10-year and two-year US bond coupons marked the deepest yield curve inversion in more than 40 years the previous day, keeping it intact by the press time. It should be observed that the US 10-year Treasury bond yields rose 0.15% while closing around 3.97% on Tuesday but the two-year counterpart gained 2.60% on a day when poking the highest levels since 2007, to 5.02% at the latest. Looking forward, German Retail Sales for January, the second readings of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the fourth quarter (Q4) and Employment Change for the said period will precede the US ADP Employment Change for February to decorate the calendar.

In doing so, the Aussie pair bounce off a two-week-old descending support line while paring the biggest daily loss since February 03. Not only the downward-sloping support line from February 17 but the oversold RSI (14) also puts a floor under the AUD/USD price. The recovery moves, however, remain elusive as the previous support line from February 06, close to 0.6625 at the latest, guards the pair’s nearby upside. Following that, the 50-SMA hurdle surrounding 0.6725 can challenge the AUD/USD buyers. It should be noted that the upside break of 0.6725 isn’t an open invitation to the AUD/USD bulls as the monthly high near 0.6775 appears the key hurdle. Meanwhile, a downside break of the aforementioned support line, close to 0.6565 at the latest, could drag the Aussie prices towards the 0.6540-20 support zone as multiple levels marked in October 2022 might challenge the bears afterward.

Powell noted that they are prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes if data warranted it and triggered a rally in the US Dollar with theUS Dollar Index(DXY) reaching its highest level since early November near 106.00. Eurostat will release the Q4 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) revision in the European session ahead of February ADP Employment Change and January Goods Trade Balance data from the US.

In response to Powell's hawkish rhetoric, Wall Street's main indexes suffered heavy losses on Tuesday and the benchmark 10-year US Treasury bond yield recovered to the 4% area. Early Wednesday US Stock index futures trade mixed while the DXY consolidates its gains at around 105.70. EUR/USDlost more than 100 pips on Tuesday and closed below 1.0550. The pair stays relatively quiet in the early European morning. The data from Germany showed that Industrial Production expanded by 3.5% on a monthly basis in January, surpassing the market expectation for an increase of 1.4%. On a negative note, Retail Sales contracted by 0.3% in the same period, coming in much worse than analysts' estimate for a growth of 2%.European Central Bank(ECB) President Christine Lagarde is scheduled to speak later in the session but she is not expected to touch on the policy or the economic outlook.

Boosted by surging US Treasury bond yields and the renewed USD strength,USD/JPYclimbed to a new 2023-high above 138.00 in the Asian trading hours before retreating modestly. The data from Japan showed earlier in the day that the Leading Economic Index and the Coincident Index in January declined to 96.5 and 96.1, respectively. AUD/USDsuffered heavy losses on Tuesday as Powell's hawkish remarks highlighted the divergence between the Fed's and the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy outlooks. Although the pair managed to recover modestly in the Asian session, it was last seen trading at around its weakest level since November near 0.6600.

The pair trades around the 1.1825 region during the first half of the European session and remains vulnerable below a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The US Dollar bulls take a breather following the recent strong run-up to a three-month top amid signs of stability in the equity markets. This, along with the extremely oversold Relative Strength Index (RSI) on hourly charts, is seen lending some support to the GBP/USD pair. That said, any meaningful recovery still seems elusive amid rising bets for more aggressive policy tightening by the Federal Reserve. In fact, the markets are now pricing in a greater chance of a jumbo 50 bps lift-off at the March FOMC policy meeting. The bets were lifted by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on Tuesday, indicating that interestratesmight need to go up faster and higher than previously anticipated. Powell further added that the Fed is prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes to combat stubbornly high inflation. The hawkishoutlookremains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields, which, along with looming recession risks, support prospects for a further near-term appreciating move for the safe-haven Greenback. In fact, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond holds steady around the 4.0% threshold and the rate-sensitive two-year Treasury note stands tall near its highest level since 2007. This adds to worries about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs. Apart from this, fading hopes over a strong Chinese economic recovery and US-China tensions should keep a lid on any optimism in the markets. Moreover, an additional rate hike by theBank of England(BoE) is already priced in, suggesting that the path of least resistance for the GBP/USD pair is to the downside. Market participants now look to theUS economic docket, featuring the release of the ADP report on private-sector employment and JOLTS Job Openings data.

EUR/USD weaker post-Powell Following an earlier drop to new multi-week lows near 1.0520, EUR/USD manages to regain some balance and flirts with the 1.0550 region on the back of the persistent firm note in the greenback. The pair, in the meantime, seems to have met some temporary contention in the 1.0525/20 band following the Powell-induced sell off on Tuesday against the backdrop of renewed bets of a 50 bps rate hike by the Fed later in the month. On the latter, the US money market appears to confirm that change of expectations after the 2-year yield trade above the 5% threshold for the first time since June 2007. A deeper retracement in the pair, however, seems not favoured for the time being, as traders reduced markedly their open interest positions on Tuesday according to advanced data from CME Group for EUR futures markets.

The pair climbs back above the 0.6600 mark and reverses a part of the previous day's Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)-inspired losses, though the fundamental backdrop still seems tilted in favour of bearish traders. Against the backdrop of RBA's dovish shift on Tuesday, the prevalent strong bullish sentiment surrounding the US Dollar adds credence to the negativeoutlookfor the AUD/USD pair. It is worth recalling that the Australian central bank signalled that it might be nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle. In contrast, Federal Reserve ChairJerome Powellindicated that interestratesmight need to go up faster and higher than previously anticipated. In the prepared remarks for his semi-annual testimony to Congress, Powell added that the Fed is prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes to combat stubbornly high inflation. This, in turn, lifted bets for a jumbo 50 bps lift-off at the March FOMC meeting and remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields. In fact, the rate-sensitive two-year US Treasury note jumps to its highest level since 2007 and pushes the USD to a three-month peak. Furthermore, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond holds steady near the 4.0% mark and fuels worries about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs. This, along with fading optimism over a strong economic recovery in China and US-China tensions, continues to weigh on investors; sentiment and suggests that the path of least resistance for the risk-sensitive Aussie remains to the downside. Hence, any subsequent move-up might be seen as an opportunity to initiate fresh bearish positions around theAUD/USDpair and runs the risk of fizzling out rather quickly.

2024-08-21,EURUSD,Neutral,When is the US ADP employment report and how could it affect EURUSD,Haresh Menghani,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/when-is-the-us-adp-employment-report-and-how-could-it-affect-eur-usd-202303081213,FX Street,"US ADP jobs report overview Wednesday's US economic docket features the release of the ADP report on private-sector employment for February, due at 13:15 GMT. Estimates point to an addition of 200K private-sector jobs during the reported month, up sharply from 109K in January. The data will provide fresh insight into the US labor market conditions and could drive expectations for the official jobs report, popularly known as NFP scheduled for release on Friday. How could the data affect EUR/USD? Ahead of the key release, signs of stability in the equity markets hold back traders from placing fresh bullish bets around the safe-haven US Dollar. This, in turn, assiststhe EUR/USD pairto hold steady above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) support, currently pegged around the 1.0500 psychological mark. That said, rising bets for a jumbo 50 bps Fed rate hike in March remain supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and continue to act as a tailwind for the Greenback. A stronger ADP report will reaffirm hawkish Fed expectations, which, in turn, should push the US bond yields and the USD higher. Conversely, any disappointment is unlikely to dent the underlying bullish sentiment surrounding the buck as investors might wait for the NFP report to see if the US labor market is cooling down. Hence, any immediate market reaction to a softer print is more likely to be limited, suggesting that the path of least resistance for the EUR/USD pair is to the downside. Traders, however, might refrain from placing aggressive bets and prefer to wait for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's second day of testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. As Matías Salord, news Reporter at FXStreet explains: “If ADP shows the private sector employment rose by more than 200K, it would reaffirm the “higher for longer” scenario, offering support to the US Dollar and should be negative for US Treasury bonds. On the contrary, it would take a contraction in employment to weigh on expectations. A negative reading could be positive for equities, emerging market currencies… for all, except the US Dollar.” Meanwhile, Eren Sengezer, Editor atFXStreet, outlines important technical levels to trade the EUR/USD pair: “Interim support for EUR/USD seems to have formed at 1.0530. With a four-hour close below that level, additional losses toward 1.0500 (psychological level), 1.0480 (2023-low) and 1.0450 (static level from December) could be witnessed.” “On the upside, 1.0560 (former support, static level) aligns as initial resistance before 1.0580 (static level). In case the latter resistance fails, buyers could show interest and EUR/USD could extend its correction toward 1.0600/1.0610 (static level, 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the four-hour chart),” Eren adds further.

Later, job openings for January in the United States dropped less than estimates, as shown by the JOLTS report. Job openings, a measure of labor demand, decreased to 10.8M.

Powell said that the Fed will likely need to raise interestratesmore than expected in response to recent strong data and is prepared to move in larger steps if the ""totality"" of incoming information suggests tougher measures are needed to control inflation. This has led the Fed funds futures markets to price in a 66% probability of a 50 basis-point hike at the Fed’s March 21-22 meeting, up from around 22% before Powell spoke on Tuesday.

Earlier, the February US ADP Employment Change report revealed that the US private sector added 242,000 jobs, more than the expected 200,000. That said, figures from both reports reinforced what Federal Reserve officials have commented about a tight labor market, which would warrant further tightening by the Federal Reserve.

Before Wall Street opened, the Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin commented that inflation is still high and that the Fed stills have work to do. Later at the US House of Representatives, Fed Chief Jerome Powell said that the Fed had not decided yet about the upcoming March meeting. Powell added that China’s reopening could spur another round of inflation due to higher commodity prices. In the Euro area (EU),European Central Bank(ECB) policymakers have remained hawkish. Earlier in the week, ECB’s Knot said that the central bank needs to keep hiking rates for some time, echoing Robert Holzmann’s words to raise rates by 50 bps due to stubborn inflation. Ignazio Visco, ECB’s Governing Council (GC) member, commented that monetary policy must remain cautious and driven by economic data, favoring gradual rate increases. In the meantime, an ECB survey showed that EU consumers expect inflation to moderate and wages to rise. Meanwhile, Citigroup expects the ECB to raise rates to 4% by mid-2023.

S&P500 futures are showing modest gains, however, the recovery move looks less confident, which could be capitalized as a selling opportunity by the market participants. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) settled above 105.20 after a volatile day inspired by upbeat United States Employment data reported by Automatic Data Processing (ADP) agency. The release of the fresh payrolls addition at 242K vs. the consensus of 200K and the prior release of 119K has confirmed that the US labor market is extremely tight and investors should be prepared to face the extreme stubbornness of inflation. It is highly expected that firms will offer higher wages to fetch talent onboard amid a shortage of labor. This will deliver more funds to households for disposal, which will increase resilience in overall consumer spending. Also, upbeat Job Openings data added fuel to the fire. The economic data landed at 10.824 million vs. the consensus of 10.6K. Higher job openings demonstrate the overall demand, which is going to propel the ConsumerPrice Index(CPI). Later this week, the official labor market data will be keenly watched by the street. As per the estimates, the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) (Feb) is expected to land at 203K lower than the former bumper release of 517K.

Key findings Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would fall by 0.3% this year, a smaller decline than its previous forecast of a 1.3% fall, after stronger activity at the end of 2022. On a quarterly basis GDP is forecast to fall 0.3% in the first quarter of 2023, before showing zero growth in the second quarter and rising by 0.2% in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2023. The BCC expects the economy to grow 0.6% next year, while the Bank of England (BoE) predicted a quarter percent contraction for 2024 last month. Britain is the only Group of Seven economy that has yet to rebound to its pre-pandemic size and the BCC forecast it would not return to that level until the final quarter of 2024. While consumers and businesses still face a hit from double-digit inflation, the BCC expects inflation to drop to 5% in the fourth quarter and 1.5% by late 2024. The BCC expects BoE rates to be a quarter-point higher at the end of the year than they are now - taking rates to 4.25% - and then for rates to be cut to 3.5% by late 2024.

In doing so, the major currency pair traces the sluggish markets amid a light calendar and an absence of major surprises from the central bankers. It’s worth noting that the mixed data from the US andEurozonejoin the cautious mood ahead of Friday’s key jobs report to also restrict the Euro currency pair’s latest moves. Recently, US President Joe Biden’s proposal to inflate the corporation tax seems to weigh on the mood and tease EUR/USD sellers. Even so, the S&P 500 Futures remain 0.05% down on a day and fail to mark any notable moves on a broader front. On Wednesday, German Retail Sales dropped to -6.9% YoY for January from -6.4% prior and -6.1% analysts’ estimations while Industrial Production growth jumped to 3.5% versus 1.4% expected and -2.4% previous readings (revised). Further, the Eurozone Employment Change eased to 0.3% QoQ during the fourth quarter (Q4) versus 0.4% market forecasts and prior whereas the seasonally adjusted Gross Domestic Product (GDP) eased to 1.8% YoY during the said pair versus 1.9% expected and previous readings. Considering the data,ECBGoverning Council member Ignazio Visco said in a statement on Wednesday, “monetary policy will have to remain prudent.” The policymaker also added, “Monetary policy should be guided by data as it becomes available.” On the other hand, the US ADP Employment Change rose to 242K in February versus 200K market forecasts and 119K prior (revised). Further, the US Goods and Services Trade Balance dropped to $-68.3B from the $-67.2B previous reading (revised) and $-68.9B analysts’ estimations. It should be noted that the US JOLTS Job Openings for January improved to 10.824M versus 10.6M expected but eased from 11.234M revised prior. It should be noted that the benchmark US Treasury bond yields rose in the last three consecutive days and raised recession fears via the widest difference between the two-year and 10-year bond coupons. That said, Federal ReserveChairman Jerome Powellrepeated his hawkish remarks in front of the House Financial Service Committee. The policymaker highlighted the data dependency of the Fed while also signaling that they have underestimated the resilience of growth and inflation. Looking ahead, the second-tier US job numbers may entertain EUR/USD traders ahead of Friday’sUnited Statesemployment report.

S&P500 futures are showing nominal losses after a weak recovery move. It seems that the dead cat bounce move by the 500-US stocks basket is fading away. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) has turned sideways above 105.20 after a mild correction, however, the upside looks favored amid upbeat United States Employment data. The solid addition of fresh payrolls in the US labor market in February due to rising demand has confirmed that fears of stubborn inflation among Fed policymakers were real. The US Automatic Data Processing (ADP) has reported an addition of 242K jobs in February, higher than the expectations of 200K and the former release of 119K. Therefore, Fed chairJerome Powellcited “Fed is prepared to announce more rates to bring down inflation.” Investors will get more clarity on the US labor market after the release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data, which will release on Friday. Apart from that, the release of theUnemployment Rateand the Average Hourly Earnings data will be of utmost importance. After the fifth consecutive 25 basis points (bps) rate hike by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and a consideration of a policy-tightening pause led by a one-time blip in the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) by RBAGovernor Philip Lowe, the Australian Dollar has faced immense heat. Now, investors are shifting their focus toward China’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) (Feb) data. Annual China’s CPI is expected to decline to 1.9% from the prior release of 2.1%. On a monthly basis, China’s CPI has been trimmed to 0.2% from the former release of 0.8%. Lower inflation might force China’s administration and the people’s Bank of China (PBoC) to infuse moreliquidityinto the economy.

In doing so, the Cable pair fails to justify the previous day’s bullish candlestick on the dailychart, namely the bullish spinning top. The reason could be linked to the pair’s sustained downside break of a 15-week-old ascending trend line, previous support near 1.1935, as well as the 200-DMA breakdown. Also adding strength to the downside bias are the bearish MACD signals. That said, the GBP/USD quote’s fresh weakness could aim for the 50%Fibonacciretracement level of November 2022 to January 2023 upside, near 1.1800. Following that, a slump toward the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level surrounding 1.1645, also known as the golden ratio, can’t be ruled out. Meanwhile, the 200-DMA hurdle of around 1.1900 restricts immediate GBP/USD recovery before highlighting the support-turned-resistance line close to 1.1935. Even ifthe Cablepair crosses the 1.1935 hurdle, a downward-sloping resistance line from early February, near 1.2055 could act as the last defense of the GBP/USD bears.

The Euro pair dropped to a fresh two-month low on Wednesday before bouncing off 1.0524. However, the quote ended the day’s trading with minor changes from the opening levels and hence portrayed a Doji candlestick that suggests a corrective bounce in the EUR/USD price. It should be noted that the Doji’s existence at a whisker beyond 100-DMA also keeps the EUR/USD buyers hopeful, especially amid the sluggish MACD and RSI signals. In a case where the Euro pair breaks the immediate 100-DMA support of around 1.0525, bears may have a bumpy road ahead due to the lows marked in January and early December 2022, respectively near 1.0480 and 1.0440. Also acting as a downside filter is the 200-DMA support of 1.0325. On the flip side, a daily closing beyond the previous support line from December 07, 2022, near 1.0570 by the press time, becomes necessary for the EUR/USD buyer’s conviction. Even so, the weekly high of around 1.0700 and the mid-February peak surrounding 1.0800 can act as extra filters towards the north.

An oscillation in the 20.00-40.00 range by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) indicates that the bearish momentum is currently active. The momentum indicator is not shown any sign of divergence and a situation of oversold. Going forward, a breakdown of Wednesday’s low at 0.6568 will drag the asst toward the horizontal support plotted from October 4 high at 0.6547 followed by the round-level support at 0.6500. In an alternate scenario, a break above Doji’s high at 0.6629 will push the Aussie asset toward December 22 low at 0.6650.

2024-09-19,EURUSD,Neutral,EURUSD extends recovery above 10550 downside seems likely as US NFP hogs limelight,Sagar Dua,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/eur-usd-extends-recovery-above-10550-downside-seems-likely-as-us-nfp-hogs-limelight-202303090606,FX Street,"EUR/USDhas stretched its recovery above the immediate resistance of 1.0550 in the early European session. The major currency pair attempted recovery from 1.0540 as theUS Dollar Index(DXY) surrendered the critical support of 105.20. For building an upside bias, the shared currency pair has to fulfill plenty of filters. The USD Index has shifted into avolatilitycontraction phase after Federal Reserve (Fed) chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish remarks-led perpendicular upside. The mighty USD Index is expected to remain sideways further till the release of the United States Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data. S&P500 futures have trimmed minor losses, however, the downside bias is still favored as US recession fears are escalating on expectations that Federal Reserve Powell will announce a bigger rate hike in March to press down the recovery move from the Consumer Price Index (CPI). A consideration of a higher terminal rate than previously anticipated from Federal Reserve Powell has already pushed two-year US Treasury yields to the highest level recorded in 2007. According to DoubleLine Capital LP Chief Investment Officer Jeffrey Gundlach, the bond market is doubling down on the prospect of a US recession after Federal Reserve ChairJerome Powellwarned of a return to large interest rate hikes, prompting the yield on two-year notes to rise to as much as 5.08%. The analyst believes that the Two-year US Treasury yields have not peaked yet, Bloomberg reported. A further increase in two-year US Treasury yields could dampen interest in growth and technology stocks as investors would be required to discount them with higherrates, which will trim their future cash flows. US Nonfarm Payrolls hogs limelight There is no denying the fact that Federal Reserve Powell has already warned the street that the central bank is prepared to raise rates further to bring down persistent inflation. However, the release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data on Friday will provide more cues. According to the estimates, the official US Employment data is expected to show a decline in the number of payrolls added in February to 203K from the former release of 514k. A figure of 203K is not so bad but looks worthless in front of January’s 514K figure. Investors should be aware that a figure of 514K was an exceptional one in the past seven months. Apart from that, theUnemployment Rateis expected to remain steady at multi-decade low figures. Also, the Average Hourly Earnings are expected to increase to 4.8% on an annual basis as the shortage of labor would be offset by higher pay-off. Higher funds in the pocket of households might bring more resilience to consumer spending. Weak German Retail Sales look insufficient to press down hawkish ECB bets The spree of contracting German Retail Sales continued on Wednesday as households are facing higher price pressures. Individuals are struggling to offset the impact of inflation-adjusted prices of goods and services as the increment in the labor cost index is lower than the pace of the rising Consumer Price Index (CPI). Annual German Retail Sales (Jan) contracted consecutively for the ninth time. The economic data contracted by 6.9% while the street was expecting a contraction of 6.1%. Also, monthly Retail Sales data contracted by 0.3% against an expansion of 2.0% as expected. Despite contracting German Retail Sales, theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) could not consider a slowdown in the policy-tightening pace as the current inflation is four times the desired level. European Central Bank PresidentChristine Lagardeis expected to continue the 50 basis points (bps) rate hike cycle in March to tame the stubborn inflation. EUR/USD technical outlook  EUR/USD is forming an Inverted Flag chart pattern near the horizontal support plotted from February 27 low at 1.0533 on a four-hour scale. The chart pattern indicates a long consolidation that is followed by a breakdown. Usually, the consolidation phase of thechartpattern serves as an inventory adjustment in which those participants initiate shorts, which prefer to enter an auction after the establishment of a bearish bias. The Euro might continue facing selling pressure near the 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is around 1.0583. An oscillation in the 20.00-40.00 range by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) indicates that the bearish momentum is currently active.

The pair sticks to a mildly positive tone and trades above the mid-1.1800s during the early part of the European session, though any meaningful upside still seems elusive. The US Dollar (USD) bulls take a breather following the recent strong run-up to over a three-month high, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor lending some support to the GBP/USD pair. That said, the prospects for more aggressive policy tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed), along with looming recession risks, act as a tailwind for the safe-haven Greenback and should cap gains for the major, at least for the time being. In fact, the markets are now pricing in a greater chance of a jumbo 50 bps lift-off at the upcoming FOMC monetary policy meeting on March 21-22. The bets were lifted by hawkish comments by Fed ChairJerome Powell, reiterating that interestrateswould have to go higher and possibly faster to tame stubbornly high inflation. This remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and favours the USD bulls. Themarket sentiment, meanwhile, remains fragile amid growing worries about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs. Apart from this, fading optimism over a strong economic recovery in China tempers investors' appetite for perceived riskier assets, which is evident from a softer tone around the equity markets and adds credence to the near-term positiveoutlookfor the Greenback. Apart from this, speculations that theBank of England(BoE) would pause the current tightening cycle suggest that the path of least resistance forthe GBP/USD pairis to the downside. Hence, any subsequent move up might still be seen as a selling opportunity.

The so far recovery in the pair comes amidst the moderate pullback in the dollar, which appears propped up at the same time by some lack of traction in US yields, all against the backdrop of rising cautiousness among traders ahead of the release of USNon-farm Payrollson Friday.

This will be the last one under current Governor Kuroda, as Kazuo Ueda has been appointed to succeed Kuroda from April on. No changes are expected in this March meeting. A policy shift by Kuroda in his last meeting would be a shocker. Danske Bank “The current BoJ Governor, Kuroda, has his last monetary policy meeting. We still think BoJ will tweak its yield curve control in the short-term. It is not likely to happenthis week, but we also were surprised last time they did it in December. Either way, we think it is a matter of time and could happen during Q2.” TDS “It is unlikely that the BoJ will rock the boat at this meeting even as CPI inflation hit a 41-year high. Governor Kuroda at his last meeting will likely keep policy unchanged, with further changes having to wait for incoming governor Ueda starting in April. We think the BoJ could shift the top end of the YCC band again in the months ahead, potentially as early as April.” SocGen “We expect the BoJ to maintain its main monetary policy, i.e. YCC and ETF purchases.  The BoJ is likely to want to see the results of this year’s spring wage negotiations, or the shunto in Japanese. Going forward, the BoJ is also likely to keep its policies unchanged in April, at the first meeting under the governor nominee, Kazuo Ueda.  However, we expect that the BoJ will widen the range of fluctuation permitted on 10-year JGB yields from ±50 bps to ±100 bps at the June monetary policy meeting. In addition, the BoJ could make it clear that it will hold the current range or YCC until further progress is made in prices and wages. We continue to expect that the YCC will not be abolished in June.” Deutsche Bank “We expect the BoJ to adhere to its present monetary policy, with YCC removal seen unlikely, although you can't rule it out given December's surprise. This will also be the last monetary policy meeting for Governor Kuroda.” Citibank “BoJ will hold a policy meeting on March 9-10, the last one for GovernorKuroda. We expect to see the policy status quo maintained.” BofA “We expect no change in the BoJ's key policy targets, including the +/-50 bps band around the zero% 10yr JGB long rate target. We summarize expected market reactions to tail risks: No change: the market to await Ueda (USD/JPY 137). Shortening target from 10yr to 5yr: It could eventually be bearish for JPY if Ueda confirms dovish stance on the front-end as a 5yr ceiling can work as forward guidance (USD/JPY 134-136). Raising 10yr target band ceiling to 1% from 0.5%: Policy uncertainty to remain high (USD/JPY 132-134). YCC removal: Market may price in earlier and faster rate hikes on the front-end (USD/JPY 128-130).” ",Neutral,-0.07,144470.0,united states,47.4,50.5,69.7,0.055,0.034,0.039,0.037,0.031,dxy,103.36,104.26,100.62,101.33,2.5714,253.081,20123.2,29723.864,4.83,4.1,102.54000091552734,102.62000274658205,102.37000274658205,102.48999786376952

The 50% of the move down from the high this week is just below that level at 1.1933. Those two levels are key for the short-term bias. Traders looking for more dollar strength would not want to see a break above both those levels. On the downside, a move back below the 200 day moving average would give sellers some comfort. The move below and close below the 200 day moving average this week was the first since January 5. Failure to stay below that level is threatening the downside move from a technical perspective. Looking at the daily chart, the low price this week moved into a swing area of what has been the floor since mid-November (see red numbered circles on the chart below). That floor area is between 1.1759 and 1.1840. The ceiling was last tested back in January near 1.24470 (see green number circles). The price action in the GBPUSD over the last 4 months has been up and down and up and back down again. With the price off the floor area, the 200 day MA will now be a short-term barometer above the floor for the pair. The weaker than expected initial jobless claims is contributing to the selling of the US dollar (higher GBPUSD). The two year yield is now down -9 basis points and back below the 5% level of 4.975%. Needless to say there is a bit of a squeeze as traders looked toward the US jobs report tomorrow at 8:30 AM. Although the survey for the BLS was a few weeks ago, the forward-looking market is still focused on the turning point for job growth and inflation.

Admittedly there are a number of targets to get to and through but those are the hurdles when the market starts a corrective move. Bigger picture....the highs seen in the USDJPY this week from yesterday's trading saw the USDJPY move above the 200 day MA (see higher green line on the chart above currently at 137.444). That break to the upside should have led to more momentum buying, AND it did initially. However, the that break could not be sustained. The price moved back below the 200 day MA was rebroken midday yesterday, and the price scooted down to the 100 day and 100 hour MA.

Although Powell’s stance turned hawkish, US Thursday’s data might help the Fed to gradually increaserates, though further confirmation is needed on Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls. At the time of writing, the GBP/USD is trading at 1.1905 after hitting a low of 1.1828. Rising unemployment claims improved market sentiment, so the GBP rises Data revealed by the BLS, Jobless Claims for the week ending on March 4 were 211K higher than expected at 195K. Despite a strong ADP report on Wednesday and more job openings than anticipated, rising unemployment claims could ease the tightness of the labor market. A downbeat US Nonfarm Payrolls report, coupled with high unemployment claims, could reduce the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) needs to tighten conditions at a faster pace. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) edges down by 0.40%, at 105.225, a tailwind for the previously battered Pound Sterling (GBP). In addition, US Treasury bond yields are easing ahead of an essential jobs report and next Tuesday’s inflation data. On the UK front, an employment report will be released on March 14.

GBP/USD Technical analysis After the GBP/USD fell to fresh YTD lows at 1.1802, the pair recovered some ground but clashed on an upslope trendline; previous support turned resistance around 1.1930s. The daily Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) reinforced the downtrend following the formation of a death cross that happened on February 3, which exacerbated the GBP/USD’s fall.

This was the highest jump in the past five months, which conveyed that the United States labor market is not tight enough as it appears to the market participants.

Additionally, the Challenger Job Cuts were down and the Continuing Jobless Claims were up. Elsewhere, disappointment from China’s monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) andProducer Price Index(PPI) data for February also dims the prospects of recovery in the world’s second-largest economy and weighs on the risk profile. On the same line could be the fears of higher taxes in the world’s biggest economy, the US, as well as the political chaos relating to it as US President Joe Biden proposes raising corporation tax from 21% to 28% in his latest budget guide ahead of Friday’s release.

It’s worth observing, however, thatBank of England(BoE) policy maker Swati Dhingra warned against interest rate hikes on Wednesday while saying that overtightening poses a more material risk at this point. On the contrary, FedChairman Jerome Powellkeeps his hawkish bias intact. Given the fact that the BoE appears less hawkish than the Fed, a likely easing in today’s UK macros may allow the return of the GBP/USD bears. However, negative surprises from the US employment data for February won’t be taken lightly as the latest market chatters put less weight on the 50 bps talks than the mid-week conditions.

It seems that investors are putting less focus on building positions as the release of the United States Nonfarm payrolls (NFP) (Feb) data will provide more clarity on further guidance. According to the estimates, the United States economy has added fresh 205K jobs, lower than the mega addition of 514K payrolls in January. TheUnemployment Rateis expected to remain steady at 3.4%. The catalyst that might grab major attention is the Average Hourly Earnings data. Firms are offering higher payouts to hire fresh talent amid an extreme shortage of labor. And higher payouts are forcing households to stretch their spending, which is ultimately fueling the US Consumer Price Index (CPI). The economic data is seen higher at 4.7% vs. the former release of 4.4%. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) is oscillating above 105.20 after a gradual correction. A release of an upbeat USNFPgamut might strengthen US Dollar bulls further. EUR/USDis facing selling pressure in extending its recovery above the supply zone in a range of 1.0577-1.0589 on an hourly scale. The 100-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.0585 also acts as a barricade for the Euro. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is struggling to sustain in the bullish range of 60.00-80.00. An absence of strength in the RSI (14) could result in exhaustion in the uptrend. A break below March 01 low at 1.0565 might drag the major currency pair toward March 08 low at 1.0524. A slippage below the same will drag the asset further toward the psychological support at 1.0500. On the flip side, a decisive move above the round-level resistance at 1.0600 will drive the asset toward February 28 high at 1.0645. A breach above the latter will expose the asset to March 01 high at 1.0691.

In doing so, the Euro pair cheers the broad weakness in the US Dollar ahead of the key US employment report for February, as well as a speech fromEuropean Central Bank(ECB) PresidentChristine Lagarde. The major currency pair snapped a two-day losing streak the previous day as mixed US data joined a retreat in the US Treasury bond yields. Adding strength to the run-up were the hawkish ECB talks and the market’s positioning for today’s key US data. However, inflation fears join the geopolitical tension to challenge the EUR/USD buyers. That said, US Initial Jobless Claims marked the biggest jump since January by rising to 211K for the week ended on March 03 versus 195K expected and 190K prior. Additionally, the Challenger Job Cuts were down and the Continuing Jobless Claims were up. With this, the early signals for Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) appear mixed and challenge the market’s push for 0.50% Fed rate hike in March, as backed by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s latest signals. Despite the mixed data, fears of inflation keep favoring the Fed hawks, especially afterChairman Jerome Powelldefends the tighter monetary policy, which in turn caps the Euro prices. It should be noted that the latest report from the New York Fed mentioned that recent upward revisions to inflation data coupled with higher-than-expected levels of inflation had changed the picture on what had appeared to be cooling in price pressures. On the other hand, ECB policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Thursday that they will bring inflation back to 2% by end-2024 or end-2025. Apart from the aforementioned catalysts, the geopolitical fears emanating from US President Joe Biden’s budget proposal for 2024 and the US partnership with the UK and Australia for nuclear submarines should also challenge the EUR/USD buyers. Against this backdrop, the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields extend the previous day’s losses to 3.88% by the press time and weigh on theUS Dollar Index(DXY), down 0.10% to 105.12 at the latest. That said, Wall Street benchmarks closed with more than 1.5% daily losses each, which in turn directed S&P 500 Futures to print mild losses by the press time. Looking ahead, market forecasts suggest an overall easing in the US employment report for February. The same contrasts with the hawkish Fed bias to highlight the odds of a strong market move in favor of the US Dollar in case of a positive surprise. However, the same requires validation from ECB’s Lagarde.

Also, investors have started shrugging offvolatilityassociated with aggressive Fed rate hike bets. Investors understand the fact that higher inflation could be tamed by restrictive measures from the Fed, therefore, more rates from the Fed are a reality. S&P500 futures have extended their losses in the Asian session after a nosedive Thursday where investors were discouraged by higher taxes on corporations, billionaires, and rich investors. Higher taxes on corporations will trim their Net Profit margins and investors would get reduced dividends on their investments. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) has dropped below Thursday’s low at 105.13 on hopes that the US labor market is not solid now as considered earlier. An 11% jump in Initial Jobless Claims and four-fold planned lay-offs by US firms are indicating that the US labor market could decelerate ahead. This might compel the Fed to continue its moderate pace for hikingratesfurther. However, the release of the USNFPwill be of utmost importance to the market. As per the projections, the US economy has recorded a jump in the number of payrolls by 203K in February. TheUnemployment Rateis seen unchanged at 3.4%. On the Pound Sterling front, Manufacturing sector data will be keenly watched. Monthly Manufacturing production (Jan) and Industrial Production are expected to contract by 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. Investors should be aware of the fact that the performance of the UK manufacturing sector has remained vulnerable in the past few months.

Following the rate decision, BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will attend the press conference, around 06:00 AM GMT, to convey the logic behind the latest policy moves. The Japanese central bank is widely expected to keep the short-term interest rate target at -0.1% while directing 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields with the bank of +/-0.50%. As today’s BoJ monetary policy meeting is the last for Governor Haruhilo Kuroda, who fetched the Asian major from the jaws of deflation during a decade-long fight with deflation, the monetary policy announcements are crucial for the USD/JPY traders to watch. Although the BOJ isn’t expected to offer any change in its monetary policy, the latest hawkish moves of the major central banks and the inflation fear in Japan, as well as receding real wages, highlight today’s BOJ as the key event. Also increasing the importance of the BOJ announcements are the chatters over Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s last dovish shot and welcome notes of the incoming Governor Kazuo Ueda. Ahead of the event, FXStreet’s Valeria Bednarik said, No changes are expected in this March meeting. Market participants anticipate the interest rate will be held at -0.1% while the Yield Curve Control (YCC) will maintain the current cap of 0.5%.  A policy shift by Kuroda in his last meeting would be a shocker, and he usually aims to avoid introducing too much noise. How could it affect the USD/JPY? USD/JPY remains depressed around 136.00, extending the previous day’s losses amid broad US Dollar weakness and downbeat Treasury bond yields, ahead of the key BoJ announcements. Japanese policymakers have already jostled with the expectations of a major move to alter the ultra-easy monetary policy. However, the recent announcement of bond-buying and talks of the town supporting the official push for higher rates in late 2023 seem to challenge the USD/JPY buyers. It should be noted, however, that the BoJ’s play of the Yield Curve Control (YCC) will be crucial to observe during today’s monetary policy releases. In a case where Kuroda manages to pave the way for future rate hikes, either via the alteration of the YCC band or dumping the YCC ultimately, the USD/JPY could extend its latest U-turn from the 200-DMA hurdle surrounding 137.50. Alternatively, an absence of no moves and the policymakers’ support the easy money could recall the USD/JPY buyers. However, the rebound will then wait for the US jobs report for clear directions.

Stretched recovery in the GBP/USD pair has met with the horizontal resistance plotted from February 17 low at 1.1915 on an hourly scale. The Cable is demonstrating an inventory adjustment phase, which could be a transfer of inventory from institutional investors to retail participants. The 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.1910 is providing cushion to the Pound Sterling. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) has slipped to near 60.00 but has not surrendered the bullish range yet. Shouldthe Cablebreak below the round-level support of 1.1900, US Dollar bulls will drag the asset further toward March 08 high at 1.1860 followed by November 17 low at 1.17633. On the flip side, a move above February 24 high at 1.2040 will drive the asset toward February 23 high around 1.2080. A breach of the latter will expose the asset to February 21 high around 1.2140.

Additional quotes 2% price target is appropriate as it is a global standard. Monetary easing has been successful in terms of supporting Japan's economic potential. Positive effects of monetary easing far exceeded side-effects. True that two sales tax hikes affected consumption, consumer inflation. Not thinking Abenomics has put too much burden on monetary policy. Premature to debate specifics on exit from monetary easing. Monetary easing exit must be conducted only when 2% inflation is sustainably, stably achieved. Inappropriate to comment on exit in 2023 or 2024. Central banks are responsible for price stability. Various factors were behind japan's deflation such as financial crisis, abnormal yen strength and rising China. 'Shunto' labour talks will most likely result in higher wages than before. Yield curve distortion has not completely been resolved although curve is becoming somewhat smooth. Market function will gradually improve. Wage trends including base salary hikes are extremely important for BoJ’s goal. Sustainable, stable achievement of inflation target must be evaluated with economy, price trends, underlying mechanism, not just by one indicator. Expect market's yield formation under new BoJ operation guideline to take some time. Close but yet to reach achievement of 2% inflation target sustainably, stably in tandem with wage growth.

The UK Office for National Statistics reported that the economy grew by 0.3% in January as compared to the 0.5% contraction recorded in the previous month and the 0.1% growth expected. This, to a larger extent, offsets the disappointing release of the UK Manufacturing and Industrial Production figures, which, in turn, is seen lending some support to the British Pound. Apart from this, the ongoing US Dollar retracement slide from a three-month low lends additional support to the GBP/USD pair. A larger-than-expected rise in the US Weekly Jobless Claims was seen as the first sign of a softening labor market and forced investors to reassess the possibility of a 50 bps lift-off at the upcoming FOMC meeting on March 21-22.

The British Pound gets a boost on the last day of the week after the monthly UK GDP report showed the economy expanded by 0.3% in January.

From a technical perspective, the intraday positive move lifts spot prices beyond the 23.6%Fibonacciretracement level of the recent corrective decline from the vicinity of the mid-1.2450 area, or a multi-month high touched in January. Furthermore, oscillators on the 4-hourly charts have been gaining strong positive traction. This, in turn, supports prospects for an extension of the upward trajectory towards testing the 38.2% Fibo. level, which coincides with the 1.2050-1.2060 supply zone. That said, technical indicators on the dailychart- though have been recovering - are yet to confirm a bullishoutlook. Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 1-hour chart is flashing overbought conditions and warrants some caution for bulls heading into the key data risks. On the flip side, the 23.6% Fibo. level, around the mid-1.1900s, now seems to protect the immediate downside.

On the other hand, a continuation towards 1.0770s could just as easily play out. EUR/USD has opened with a large gap in the open and is trading around 1.0680 after closing on Friday at 1.0639 after a mixed Nonfarm Payrolls report triggered a sell-off in the US Dollar. However, as analysts at ANZ Bank said in a note before the open, ´´after so much anticipation it was ironic that it got lost in the noise, but non-farm payrolls rose 311k in February, indicating very strong momentum injobsgrowth continues.´´ Additionally, the analysts explained that ´´the January data was barely revised, and the 3-month average of jobs growth is now 355k vs 321k in the prior three months. Theunemployment rateedged higher to 3.6% as the participation rate rose 0.1% to 62.5%. Average hourly earnings slowed to 0.2% MoM (4.6% YoY). That will be of some comfort to the Fed, but the weaker monthly rise owed much to strong gains in low-paying jobs: leisure and hospitality and retail, suggesting firms expect discretionary consumer spending to remain strong,´´ they said. Nevertheless, a significant repricing across the curve and in the terminal rate weighed on the US Dollar due to weaker-than-expected wages. The Fed funds rate implied upper bound fell from 5.89% to 5.5% and the probability of a 50bp hike in March declined substantially. EUR/USD technical analysis  The price is reaching a liquidity area that could see the bears move in with eyes on a 1.0590 target in a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement for the day ahead.

Even if the EUR/USD manages to surpass the 1.0710 resistance, the 50%Fibonacciretracement level of its early February-March downside, near 1.0780, will precede the mid-February swing high near 1.0810 to challenge the bulls.

The United States added 311,000 payrolls in February and the unemployment rate rose to 3.6%. However, a survey of economists polled by Reuters expected the United States to have added 205,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.4%.

Also, Britain's economy was shown to have grown by more than expected in January, further allaying fears of a recession.

Even so, the Yen pair remains on the back foot for the third consecutive day as Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s retirement propels hawkish calls for the Japanese central bank’s next moves. Also challenging the pair buyers could be the cautious mood ahead of this week’s top-tier data/events, including the BoJ Minutes and the US consumer-centric numbers including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Sales for February. The Yen pair’s latest rebound could be linked to the recently firmer US Treasury bond yields, as well as risk-on sentiment in the market, mainly driven by the US regulators’ efforts to tame the financial market risks emanating from the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank. That said, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields pare the biggest daily loss in four months near 3.75% while the S&P 500 Futures also rebound from a nine-week low.

S&P 500 Futures and US Treasury bond yields consolidate the previous day’s losses after the late plan for the US authorities to tame the financial crisis. Despite the risk-on mood, escalating hawkish bets on the BoJ’s next move, especially after Kuroda’s retirement, seem to exert downside pressure on the USD/JPY prices. On the same line could be the Federal Reserve (Fed) watchers’ indecision after Friday’s mixed US employment data. That said, the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) grew more than 205K expected to 311K in February, versus 504K (revised), while theUnemployment Raterose to 3.6% for the said month compared to 3.4% expected and prior. Further, the Average Hourly Earnings rose on YoY but eased on monthly basis for February whereas the Labor Force Participation increased during the stated month. Looking forward, Wednesday’sBoJMinutes will be crucial to confirm the latest hawkish bias for the Japanese central bank’s next move, which in turn can weigh on the USD/JPY prices if matching market forecasts. However, firmer prints of the US consumer-centric numbers could renew hawkish Fed bets ahead of the all-important March Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and may recall the USD/JPY bulls.

Further, the Average Hourly Earnings rose on YoY but eased on monthly basis for February whereas the Labor Force Participation increased during the stated month. The data, however, failed to impress the US Dollar buyers as the market’s risk-off mood drowned the US Treasury bond yields and the greenback. It’s worth observing that the market’s fears of no Fed rate hikes in March, due to the latest imbalance in the US banking sector due to the SVB and Signature Bank fallout, also seem to weigh n the US Dollar. Amid these plays, S&P 500 Futures bounced off a 2.5-month low, up nearly 1.0% around 3,905 by the press time whereas the US Treasury bond yields recover from the monthly low, after posting the biggest daily loss of the year 2023 on Friday. Moving on, market plays may witness a sluggish session on Monday amid a cautious mood ahead of top-tier data/events. That said, the ECB is likely to announce a 0.50% rate hike and can join the latest risk-on mood to propel the EUR/USD price. Though, strong prints of the US consumer-centric data and inflation may renew hawkish Fed bias and can exert downside pressure on the major currency pair moving forward.

In doing so, the Yen pair seesaws around the lowest levels in one month, marked earlier in the day, as sellers poke the 134.00 threshold. A clear U-turn from the 200-DMA, as well as a downside break of the 100-DMA, joins a sustained downside break of a five-week-old bullish channel to favor USD/JPY sellers. On the same line could be the strongest bearish MACD signals since early December 2022. With this, the Yen pair appears all set to slump toward the 50-DMA support of 132.50. However, the early February swing highs near 132.90 seem to prod the USD/JPY sellers of late. In a case where the USD/JPY price remains bearish past the 50-DMA, the 130.00 round figure and the previous monthly low surrounding 128.00 will be in the spotlight. On the flip side, a convergence of the 100-DMA and the aforementioned channel’s lower line, close to 135.85, holds the key to USD/JPY pair’s recovery.

The Aussie pair’s latest inaction could be linked to its struggle to overcome the five-week-old descending resistance line amid the broadly risk-on mood, as well as the US Dollar weakness. While portraying the mood, S&P 500 Futures bounced off a 2.5-month low, up nearly 1.60% around 3,960 by the press time. It’s worth noting that the Asia-Pacific equities trade mixed as they’re yet to overcome Friday’s bond andstockmarket rout, as well as bear the burden of China-linked fears. A new term for China’s President Xi Jinping keeps the Sino-American tension on the table as he said earlier on Monday that they must resolutely oppose the interference of external forces, 'split' of Taiwan. It’s worth mentioning that Wall Street saw the red on Friday while the US bond yields also dropped the most in a month amid fears emanating from the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) fallout. However, the US Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took joint actions to tame the risks during the weekend.  While reacting to the US regulators’ actions, US President Joe Biden said, “American people and American businesses can have confidence that their bank deposits will be there when they need them.” The fallout of the SVB and Signature Bank flagged fragile conditions of the US banks, which in turn pushed back hopes of more rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve (Fed). With this in mind, Goldman Sachs expects to rate hike in March while the Fed Fund Futures also cut previously upbeat odds favoring a 0.50% rate lift in the Fed rate in March. Amid these plays,US Dollar Index(DXY) drops to the lowest level in a month, down 0.80% near 103.80. Looking ahead, Tuesday’s US ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) for February to direct immediate market moves. Following that, the Retail Sales and preliminary readings of the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for March, up for publishing on Wednesday and Friday, will be crucial for AUD/USD traders to watch. At home, Thursday’s Aussiejobs reportwill be observed to reconfirm recent dovish bias surrounding the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).

US yields are falling sharply at a speed not seen in years. The US 10-year was above 4% last week and on Monday bottomed at 3.42%. The slide in yields has weakened the US Dollar against it main European competitors. The DXY is down by almost 1% at the lowest in four weeks. The ramifications of the banking crisis in the US crossed the Atlantic. In the UK, the government and theBank of Englandfacilitated a deal for HSBC o buy Silicon Valley Bank UK for 1 pound. On Tuesday, before US CPI, the UK will release employment numbers. The GBP/USD is trading at monthly highs at 1.2176, with a strong bullish momentum. On the upside, the next strong resistance area is seen at 1.2200. The pair is retaking the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The 1.2100 zone and 1.2060 have become relevant support levels.

The 2 year yield (see chart above) moved back up to 4.266% from an intraday low just below 4.00% at 3.997%.  The yield is now only down -37 basis points. It was down close to -60 basis points at the lows. Looking at the daily chart of the 2 year, the low yield today did get within about 4 basis points of the 200 day MA. The yield has not been below the 200 day MA since August 2021. For the USDJPY, the price moved up to test its 200 bar moving average on the four hour chart (see chart below). That moving average comes in at 133.374. The high price has reached 133.295. The price is coming off of that level as the 2 year yield has already moved back down to 4.15% as I type.  Man....things can move quickly. In any case, the 200 bar moving average on the 4 hour chart remains a topside barometer given the sharp move to the downside seen over the last few trading days. The high for the USDJPY reached 137.906 on Wednesday. The price had moved down 560 pips from that high. A corrective move higher is not that surprising. Having said that, however, the yield move back to the upside and stock rebound has been helpful. Nevertheless, it would still take a move above the 200 bar moving average at 133.374 to get over that hump. Above that there will be other targets including 133.65 and the broken 38.2% retracement of the 2023 trading range at 133.83.

Meanwhile, the US Dollar continued to bleed heavily on Monday as markets bet the Federal Reserve will be less aggressive in raising interestratesto curb inflation. US authorities have made moves to try to lessen the damage from the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.A new Bank Term Funding Program will offer loans from the Federal Reserve of up to one year to depository institutions, backed by United States Treasuries and other assets these institutions hold. Consequently, theUS dollar index, or DXY, which measures the greenback vs. a basket of major currencies, has dropped to a fresh low of 103.484, tracking the fall in short-dated Treasury yields. The two-year note was paying as low as 3.997% at one point in New York trade and tumbled from the start of the week´s highs of 4.534% in the biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2008, on track for its biggest three-day decline since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Meanwhile, Fed funds futures have been repriced as traders expect that the Fed's terminal rate will be lower.

Moreover, futures are showing a 21% chance of no hikes in rates from the Federal Open Market Committee when announcements will be made on March 22. US Consumer Price Index will be key This all makes for a very important red calendar event this week in the US ConsumerPrice Indexdata. This will be released on Tuesday morning in the US session and traders will use the data to speculate how the Federal Reserve will react later this month when the central bank will meet to decide on its interest rate setting. ´´The release of US CPI inflation data tomorrow is expected to show headline price pressures remains elevated at 6% YoY, well above the Fed’s 2% Inflation forecast,´´ analysts at Rabobank said. ´´If the Fed were to back away from its tightening cycle, it may have a credibility issue on its hands. Additionally, for some years Fed officials have argued that monetary policy is not the right tool to tackle financial stability,´´ the analysts noted. ´´Given the announcement that the Fed has made over the weekend in conjunction with the Treasury to stop contagion risks from the SVB crisis, the FOMC may favor continuing to hike rates next week with a focus on the inflation risks,´´ the analysts at Rabobank argued. ´´We maintain our 1- and 3-month forecasts of EUR/USD 1.06 and 1.06 respectively, though clearly, we will be watching the forward guidance at this month’s Federal Reserve (and ECB) policy meetings closely,´´ the analysts explained.

AUD/USDhas not capitalized much on the previous trading day in wake of the backstop provided by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and US Treasury.

Looking ahead, the market is heading into US CPI data with caution due to the numerous dynamic changes that occurred on Monday after the SVB fallout event. Many key market forecasters are rolling back their 50 basis points (bps) Fed rate hike expectation for 22 March. Given the fact that higher borrowing cost across the globe is putting pressure on high-leverage business like tech companies, which are struggling to keep on with repayments on their debt amidst higher interest rate, therefore the banking system is facing a big problem with their non-performing assets. Moreover, a continuously rising interest rate will likely hammer the banking system as per the aforementioned analogy. Hence the market is expecting no overstretching on the rate fronts.

In doing so, the Yen pair cheers the market’s consolidation of the moves induced by the US actions to tame fears emanating from the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the Signature Bank. Adding strength to the quote’s rebound could be the recent recovery in the US Treasury bond yields after the previous day’s bond market havoc.

It should be noted that the US two-year Treasury bond yields dropped the most since 1987 the previous day while the latest rebound could be a U-turn from the 200-DMA support ahead of important US data. It should be noted that the traders witnessed heavy bond buying the previous day as the US banking regulators rushed to defend the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the Signature Bank after their fallouts. US banking regulators undertook joint actions to tame the risks emanating from SVB and Signature Bank during the weekend.  While announcing the plan, US President Joe Biden noted on Monday that investors in those banks will not be protected and reminded that ""no one is above the law."" However, the US President also vowed to take whatever action was needed to ensure the safety of the US banking system, per Reuters. However, the policymakers from the UK and Europe, as well as some of the Asia-Pacific majors, have ruled out the odds of witnessing a financial crisis at home after the SVB saga, which in turn might have also pleased the USD/JPY buyers of late.

Meanwhile, the alpha offered on the 10-year US Treasury yields has rebounded further to 3.57%. Investors are awaiting the release of the US inflation, which could be a major trigger for the USD Index. Analysts at Credit Suisse expect “Core CPI inflation to remain steady at 0.4% MoM in February, causing the YoY reading to tick down to 5.5%. Energy and food prices are likely to moderate, with headline inflation also coming in at 0.4% MoM. A reading in-line with our expectations would be uncomfortably high for the Fed, but still consistent with gradual disinflation this year.” On the Pound Sterling front, the release of the UK Employment data will be of significant importance. As per the consensus, the Claimant Count Change (Feb) will drop by 12.4K, lower than the former release of 12.9K. Three-monthUnemployment Rateis expected to increase to 3.8% from the prior release of 3.7%.

The sharp rebounds came on Monday upon the US Dollar's weakness. Receding bets for a 50-bps Federal Reserve (Fed) rate hike have prompted AUD/USD to surge higher, although the downside bias is likely to remain intact, in a risk-averse environment led by SVB fallout. Any upside momentum for AUD/USD is likely to remain capped at Monday’s high around the 0.6713 mark, which is a support-turned-resistance and coincides with a descending trendline starting from February on a dailychart. A break above will lead the pair to confront the next resistance at around 0.6766 which is pegged with 21-day Moving Average (DMA). Both the 21-DMA and 50-DMA are pegged above the current price level, which is technically exerting overhead price pressure on AUD/USD and also confirming the bearish bias for the pair. Downside support is seen at 0.6560, which is a key support level for the AUD/USD. A convincing break below will likely put the pair in a vacuum without any major support for a long distance. Regarding the said level, the pair has respected it on the last three attempts and AUD/USD looks resilient above that price point. The intermediate support lies at the psychological 0.6500 level.

TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) has extended its recovery to near 104.00 as investors have trimmed short-liquidation after a sheer sell-off.

Looking at core (ex. food and energy) categories, shelter prices are set to peak imminently as the typical lags with new leases that are resetting at lower rates kick in, but continued pressure in core services outside of the shelter, in line with the tight labor market, will keep the Fed on a tightening path. S&P500 futures have shown a dramatic recovery in the Asian session after a choppy Monday as investors are anticipating a smaller interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve (Fed) as the catastrophic collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVG) has deepened fears of the US recession. Meanwhile, the return generated on 10-year US Treasury yields has extended above 3.57%.

The UK Office for National Statistics reported that the number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits fell by 11.2K in February as compared to the 12.4 decline anticipated. Adding to this, the previous month's reading was also revised to a fall of 30.3K in the Claimant Count Change from 12.9 estimated originally. Furthermore, the jobless rate held steady at 3.7% during the three months to January against expectations for a modest uptick to 3.8%. This, to a larger extent, helped offset a slowdown in the UK wage growth data and does little pushback against market bets for additional rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE) later this month, which lends some support to the British Pound. That said, a goodish pickup in the US Dollar demand, bolstered by rebounding US Treasury bond yields, acts as a headwind for the GBP/USD pair, at least for the time being. The uptick in the US bond yields comes after the US authorities moved to limit the fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SNB) and could further be attributed to some repositioning trade ahead of the US consumer inflation figures. However, expectations that the US central bank will slow, if not halt, its interest rate-hiking cycle in the wake of the strain on the US banking system could keep a lid on any meaningful upside for the US bond yields and hold back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets. Traders might also prefer to wait on the sidelines and await the release of the crucial US CPI report, due later during the early North American session. This week's US economic docket also features theProducer Price Index(PPI) and monthly Retail Sales figures on Wednesday, which should influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus tothe GBP/USD pair.

However, speculations that theFedcould slow, if not halt, its rate-hiking cycle, amid the strain on the US banking system, might cap any meaningful upside for the USD and lend some support tothe GBP/USD pair. Traders might also refrain from placing aggressive bets and prefer to move to the sidelines ahead of next week's key central bank event risks - the  two-day FOMC meeting starting Tuesday, followed by the BoE decision on Thursday. This further makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying before confirming that the GBP/USD pair's recent recovery from the 1.1800 mark, or the YTD low touched last week, has run its course.

Spot prices, however, struggle to capitalize on the modest intraday uptick and remain below the 0.6700 round-figure mark, at least for the time being. The US Dollar comes under some selling pressure after the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the headlineCPIrose by 0.4% in February as compared to the 0.5% recorded in the previous month. Adding to this, the yearly rate decelerated from 6.4% to 6.0% during the reported month. The data reaffirms expectations that the Federal Reserve will slow, if not halt, its rate-hiking cycle amid the strain on the US banking system, which, in turn, weighs on the Greenback and lends support to the AUD/USD pair. That said, the Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 0.5% on a monthly basis, beating estimates for a reading of 0.4%. This comes on the back of easing fears of a broader systemic crisis, which remains supportive of a strong intraday rally in the US Treasury bond yields and helps limit the downside for the USD. Apart from this, the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) recent dovish shift, signalling that it might be nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle, contributes to capping the AUD/USD pair. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for a sustained strength above the 0.6700 mark and a subsequent move beyond the overnight swing high, around the 0.6715 region, before placing fresh bullish bets around the AUD/USD pair. Moreover, the lack of any meaningful buying warrants some caution before confirming that spot prices have bottomed out in the near term and that the recent downfall witnessed since early February has run its course.

Elsewhere, in the US, inflation data in the US ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) rose 0.4% last month after accelerating 0.5% in January. In the 12 months through February, the CPI increased by 6.0%, a slower pace than the 6.4% annualized gain in January, however, this was still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Consequently,  the US Dollar found some demand and made a session high in the US but it has since turned lower while futures priced in a Fed rate cut by year's end. Fed funds futures show a change in sentiment with regard to this month's FOMC meeting. However, the CME´s Fed Watch Tool shows a 28.4% likelihood theFedwould stand pat at the end of its two-day policy meeting on March 22, slightly down from the prior day following the CPI data.

The Aussie asset is looking to recapture the round-level resistance of 0.6700 as investors are not worried anymore for fears of bigger rate hikes from the Federal Reserve (Fed). An anticipated decline in the United States inflation, higherUnemployment Rate, lower-than-expected increase in Average Earnings, and the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse indicate that theFedwould be lighter on interest rates to safeguard the interest of investors and to restore consumer confidence. S&P500 futures are showing a marginal correction after a super-bullish Tuesday, portraying a minor long-liquidation amid an overall risk-on mood. However, Moody’s Investors Service cut its view on the entire banking system to negative from stable, as reported by CNBC. Credit rating firms cited it as a “rapidly deteriorating operating environment” despite regulators’ efforts to safeguard the interest of depositors and institutions that were hit with liquidity issues. The US Dollar Index (DXY) has managed to safeguard the 103.60 support, however, the downside seems likely as the risk-appetite theme is getting more traction. Meanwhile, the alpha provided on 10-year US Treasurybondshas scaled to 3.69%. After the expected decline in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), investors are awaiting the release of the Retail Sales data. Analysts at Credit Suisse expect “Retail sales to fall 0.9% MoM in February, partly reversing a strong increase in January. Noisy seasonal adjustments and unseasonably warm weather likely played a role in last month’s report, so a normalization lower is likely.” On the Australian Dollar front, Reuters reported that Australia’seconomic outlookwill be scrutinized by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) for rate hikes, unlike other nations that are focusing on SVB collapse. Analysts at three of the top four lenders - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank, and ANZ Group Holdings - continue to expect RBA GovernorPhilip Loweto deliver its 11th consecutive rate hike next month.

The news also mentioned that UK’s Hunt has dismissed calls from other lawmakers in the ruling Conservative Party for big tax cuts now to boost their fortunes before an election expected in 2024. ""In the autumn we took difficult decisions to deliver stability and sound money,"" Hunt is due to say, according to excerpts of his budget speech. ""Today, we deliver the next part of our plan: A budget for growth,"" he will add reported Reuters. Key quotes Hemmed in by his promise to lower the burden of Britain's 2.5 trillion pounds ($3.0 trillion) of debt, Hunt will seek to tackle some of the causes of Britain's long-term economic funk. Having ruled out a major spending spree or big tax cuts, Hunt will address the acute shortage of candidates for jobs by changing childcare and welfare rules, something he says will help get hundreds of thousands of people back into work. The Guardian newspaper said Hunt would announce a 4 billion-pound childcare expansion for one and two-year olds in England. He is also expected to announce measures to improve skills training and give a green light to 12 investment zones. In an attempt to soften that tax hit, Hunt has hinted at new incentives for business investment. He is also under pressure from nurses, teachers and other public sector employees who striking for higher pay, while the armed forces say they need more money to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.

The pair is hovering around the 1.0732 level at the time of writing, which is a multi-tested support zone pegged by the 50-DMA on the daily time frame. A successive break to the 50-DMA, which also coincides with a 38.2% Fib level, will reinforce the EUR/USD toward the next resistance zone starting from the 1.07942 level. Heading toward the ultimate destination at the 1.0800 level, EUR/USD has to surpass the 50% Fib level placed just beneath the aforementioned round figure mark. The 50-DMA has been keeping a lid on EUR/USD for the last two days despite strong bullish momentum and a mild United States ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) release on Tuesday. The bullish momentum keeps on rolling for EUR/USD. The market is heading into the next Federal Reserve (Fed) FOMC meeting with a lighter foot and is pricing in just a 25 basis points (bps) rate hike, less than the 50 basis points that was being priced prior to the banking sector worries. Downside momentum may resurface due to delicate market conditions, particularly as we experienced financial turbulence earlier this week, this could potentially stimulate demand for the safe haven US Dollar. Any downside price pressure is likely to be limited around the 23.6% Fib level at 1.0660, which coincides with both the previous day’s low as well as 21-DMA.

The last monetary policy announcement by ex-BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda lacked surprises as a continuation of an ultra-dovish policy stance was highly required to keep inflation steady near desired rates. The commentary in BoJ minutes that the central bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner, indicates that the ultra-loose monetary policy would stay for a longer period. Also, the BoJ will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner S&P500 futures have trimmed losses generated after a super-bullish settlement on Tuesday. Positive commentary from Federal Reserve (Fed) Governor Michelle Bowman on United States banking system has infused optimism in risk-perceived currencies. Fed policymaker cited “The US banking system has substantial liquidity and capital, and the Fed board is closely observing developments. The US Dollar index (DXY) looks vulnerable above 103.50 as US Consumer Price Index (CPI) has softened and theFedis likely to go light on interest rates to avoid recession in the American economy. The alpha provided on 10-year US Treasurybondshas climbed to near 3.69% despite rising odds for a 25 basis point (bps) interest rate hike by the Fed. According to the CME FedWatch tool, around 70% chances are favoring a 25 bps rate hike push to a 4.75-5% interest rate. For further guidance, the release of the US Retail Sales andProducer Price Index(PPI) (Feb) data will be keenly watched. According to the estimates from RBC Economics “US retail sales edged 0.1% lower in February, with sales in the motor vehicle sector shrinking by 3.3% during that month.” Apart from that, the monthly US PPI is expected to expand by 0.3%, lower than the former release of 0.7%. While the annual figure would soften to 5.4% from the prior release of 6%. A decline in the PPI figures would indicate that producers are struggling to expand the prices of goods and services at factory gates due to a decline in the overall demand. Eventually, it would trim the demand for labor and the overall inflation ahead.

In doing so, the Aussie pair prints the first daily loss in three as the bulls flirt with a downward-sloping resistance line from early February. In addition to the six-week-old descending resistance line, sluggish RSI (14) and indecisive MACD signals also challenge the AUD/USD pair buyers unless the quote stays below the 0.6700 trend line resistance. Even if the Aussie pair crosses the 0.6700 round figure, a convergence of the 100-DMA and the 200-DMA, around 0.6770-75 at the latest, appears a tough nut to crack for the bulls. In a case where the AUD/USD price remains firmer past 0.6775, the December 2022 high near 0.6895 and the 0.6900 round figure may act as the last defenses of the pair bears. On the flip side, pullback remains elusive beyond the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the risk-barometer pair’s upside from October 2022 to February 2023, close to 0.6655 by the press time. Following that, the latest swing low and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, also known as the golden Fibonacci ratio, respectively around 0.6565 and 0.6550 in that order, could probe the AUD/USD bears before giving them control.

That said, the Cable pair traders await the key UK Budget Report, as well as the US Retail Sales for February, amid mixed sentiment and sluggish markets. It should be noted that the mostly mixed UK data and a lack of hawkish bias surrounding the Bank of England (BoE) seem to weigh on the GBP/USD prices amid the cautious mood ahead of an important event. On Tuesday, UK’s headline ILOUnemployment Ratereprinted 3.7% for three months to January versus 3.8% expected whereas the Claimant Count Change improved to -11.2K in February from -30.3K (revised) prior and -12.4K market forecasts. Further details suggest that the Average Earnings Including Bonus matched 5.7% analysts’ estimations for three months to January, versus an upwardly revised 6.0% prior, whereas the ex-Bonus figures came in as 6.5% compared to 6.6% expected and 6.7% previous readings. Following the UK data, the odds of the Bank of England’s (BoE) easy rate hikes, or policy pivot, gained attention. “Growth in pay in Britain - which theBank of Englandis watching closely as it weighs up whether to pause its run of interest rate hikes next week - lost pace in the three months to January, official data showed on Tuesday,” said Reuters. Additionally, the latest survey details from the UK Incomes Data Research (IDR) suggests that British employers agreed on pay rises averaging 5.0% during the three months to the end of January, well above historic norms, and a tight labor market means pay settlements are likely to remain high. On the other hand, the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and CPI ex Food and Energy both matched 6.0% and 5.5% YoY market forecasts, versus 6.4% and 5.6% respective previous readings. It should be noted that the market consensus of 0.4% MoM for the CPI, versus 0.5% prior, also proved right but the CPI ex Food & Energy rose to 0.5% compared to 0.4% analysts’ estimates and prior. “The Federal Reserve is seen raising its benchmark rate a quarter of a percentage point next week and again in May, as a government report showed U.S. inflation remained high in February, and concerns of a long-lasting banking crisis eased,” said Reuters following the US inflation data release. Talking about the risks, the US policymakers’ rejections of fears emanating from the latest fallouts of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank seem to help the US Dollar regain its upside bias, especially amid recently firmerFedbets. Late on Tuesday, US Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown and Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman ruled out chatters suggesting the grim conditions of the US banking industry. However, Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that a raft of tougher capital and liquidity requirements are under review, as well as steps to beef up annual “stress tests” that assess banks’ ability to weather a hypothetical recession, according to a person familiar with the latest thinking among U.S. regulators. “The rules could target firms with between $100 billion to $250 billion in assets, which at present escape some of the toughest requirements,” per WSJ. Amid these plays, S&P 500 Futures remain sidelined despite Wall Street’s upbeat closing. Further, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields grind near 3.68% by the press time, after posting the biggest daily gain in five weeks the previous day, while the two-year bond coupons extend the previous day’s recovery from the six-month low to 4.31% at the latest. Looking ahead, UK Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt will announce the British budget in the Parliament around 12:30 GMT on Wednesday and will be able to propel the GBP/USD prices if matching the upbeat forecasts. Ahead of the event, Reuters quoted the Guardian newspaper as saying that UK Finance Minister Hunt would announce a 4 billion-pound childcare expansion for one and two-year olds in England. The news also added that UK’s Hunt is also expected to announce measures to improve skills training and give a green light to 12 investment zones. Apart from the UK budget, US Retail Sales for February, expected -0.3% MoM versus 3.0% prior, will be important to watch for clear directions.

In doing so, the quote justifies the bearish signals from the moving average crossover, as well as the downbeat Relative Strength Index (RSI) line, placed at 14. That said, the 50-SMA prods the 100-SMA from above and joins the downbeat RSI line to suggest the USD/JPY pair’s further declines. However, a five-week-old horizontal support area near 133.90-85 appears a tough nut to crack for the Yen pair bears. In a case where the USD/JPY slips beneath the 133.85 support, the odds of witnessing an extended south-run towards a two-month-old ascending support line, close to 130.55 by the press time, can’t be ruled out. Meanwhile, an area comprising multiple tops marked since February 17, near 135.05-15, restricts immediate USD/JPY upside. Even if the quote traces the bullish MACD signals and crosses the 135.15 resistance, a convergence of the 50-SMA and the 100-SMA, around 135.65-70 by the press time, will be crucial to watch as it holds the key for the USD/JPY run-up towards the monthly high of 137.91.

On monetary policy, Kuroda said, BoJ must maintain current monetary easing, but there will also likely be scope to consider steps to address side-effects of easy policy. By maintaining current easy policy, it's possible to sustainably, stably achieve our price target, accompanied by wage growth, while looking after side-effects of our policy. BoJ will surely head for an exit from easy policy and has ability to do so, when 2% inflation target is sustainably, stably met. When BoJ decided to adopt negative rate policy in Jan 2016, my feeling was that many board members were in favor of the idea but some thought doing so at that timing was premature.

In doing so, the Cable pair remains firmer for the second consecutive day amid downbeat US Dollar, as well as due to the price-positive catalysts. It should be noted, however, that the cautious mood ahead of the next week’s key monetary policy meetings from theBank of England(BoE) and the Federal Reserve (Fed), as well as the final voting on the Brexit verdict, keeps the Cable buyers chained. The multi-month-old labor problems in the UK are likely to end soon as The Guardian said, “The government has confirmed it is making a significant new pay offer to National Health Services (NHS) staff in England, including a one-off bonus which unions say amounts to £2.5bn.” the news also adds that the Unions involved in the pay talks said further strikes by ambulance staff and other NHS workers had been suspended and they would recommend members accept the new offer. Elsewhere, hopes of witnessing a sooner and positive end to the Brexit deadlock also allow the GBP/USD buyers to remain hopeful as The Telegraph said that the UK’s Members of the Parliament (MPs) will deliver their final verdict on Rishi Sunak’s newBrexitdeal next week after Downing Street confirmed a vote on the Windsor Framework will be held on Wednesday. Above all, the market’s cautious optimism and the US Dollar’s positioning for the next week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) monetary policy meeting seem to allow the GBP/USD buyers to keep the reins for the third consecutive week. The mildly positive sentiment could be linked to the global policymakers’ and bankers’ efforts to avoid the return of 2008’s financial crisis, as well as comments from rating agencies suggesting no more challenges for the banking sector. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 Futures pick up bids to pare the intraday losses around 3,995, following an upbeat close of the Wall Street benchmarks, whereas the US Treasury bond yields fade the previous day’s corrective bounce off the monthly low. Looking forward, the UK’sConsumer Inflation Expectationsfor March will precede the preliminary readings of the US Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for March and the UoM 5-year Consumer Inflation Expectations for the said month to direct intraday GBP/USD moves ahead of the key week.

2025-04-02,GBPUSD,Neutral,GBPUSD trims a part of its intraday gains holds comfortably above 12100 amid weaker USD,Haresh Menghani,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/gbp-usd-trims-a-part-of-its-intraday-gains-holds-comfortably-above-12100-amid-weaker-usd-202303170956,FX Street,"The GBP/USD pairbuilds on the previous day's strong move up and scales higher for the second successive day on Friday. The pair, however, retreats a few pips from the daily peak touched during the early part of the European session and is currently placed around the 1.2135-1.2130 region, still up over 0.20% for the day. Expectations that the Federal Reserve will adopt a less hawkish stance in the wake of worsening economic conditions exert heavy downward pressure on the US Dollar, which, in turn, lends support to the GBP/USD pair. Last week's collapse of two mid-size US banks - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank - forced investors to scale back bets for more aggressive policy tightening by the US central bank. In fact, the markets are now pricing in a nearly 90% chance of a smaller 25 bps lift-off the upcoming FOMC meeting on March 21-22, which, along with signs of stability in the financial markets, weigh on the safe-haven Greenback. Multi-billion-dollar lifelines for troubled banks in the US and Europe ease fears about widespread contagion. This, in turn, boosts investors' confidence, which is evident from a modest recovery in the equity markets. That said, persistent worries about a full-blown global banking crisis keep a lid on the optimism. Furthermore, the Bank of England's (BoE) quarterly survey showed that the median UK public's expectations for inflation for the coming year dropped sharply in February. This reaffirms bets that theBank of England(BoE) will pause its rate-hiking cycle next week and contributes to capping the GBP/USD pair. Market participants now look to the release of the Michigan US Consumer Sentiment Index for short-term opportunities later during the early North American session on Friday. The focus, however, will remain on the key central bank event risks next week - the outcome of the highly-anticipated FOMC policy meeting, scheduled to be announced next Wednesday, followed by the BoE policy meeting on Thursday. Nevertheless, the GBP/USD pair seems poised to register modest weekly gains and remains at the mercy of the USD price dynamics.

Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted yesterday that the outlook is mixed and we expected USD to trade in a choppy manner between 132.30 and 134.30. We did not anticipate the sharp drop to 131.71 and the strong bounce from the low (USD closed higher by 0.24% at 133.72). Theoutlookremains mixed and today, we expect USD to trade in a broad range between 132.50 and 134.50.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We continue to hold the same view as yesterday (16 Mar, spot at 133.40) where while there is scope for USD to weaken further, the major support at 131.50 is unlikely to come into view so soon. Note that USD dropped briefly to 131.71 in early NY trade before rebounding strongly. Overall, only a breach of 135.10 (no change in ‘strong resistance’) would indicate that 131.50 is not coming into view.’",Negative,-0.66,442181.0,united states,47.4,50.5,69.7,0.055,0.034,0.039,0.037,0.031,dxy,103.36,104.26,100.62,101.33,2.33375,258.603,20669.5,29976.638,4.39,4.2,102.06999969482422,103.37999725341795,101.2699966430664,103.1500015258789

The pair, however, manages to rebound a few pips from the daily low touched during the early European session and now trades above the 133.00 mark, still down nearly 0.40% for the day. Growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve will adopt a less hawkish stance at its upcoming meeting on March 21-22 exerts fresh downward pressure on the US Dollar, which, in turn, is seen weighing on the USD/JPY pair. In fact, the markets are now pricing in a greater chance of a smaller 25 bps lift-off in the wake of last week's collapse of two mid-size US banks - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. This leads to a fresh leg down in the US Treasury bond yields and continues to undermine the Greenback. Apart from this, the global flight to safety benefits the Japanese Yen (JPY) and further contributes to the offered tone around the USD/JPY pair. Despite multi-billion-dollar lifelines for troubled banks in the US and Europe, investors are still trying to determine whether the risk of a full-blown global banking crisis has been tamed and remain concerned about widespread contagion. This, along with looming recession fears, takes its toll on the risk sentiment, which is evident from a softer tone around the equity markets. That said, a more dovish stance adopted by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) should keep a lid on any further gains for the JPY and help limit losses for the USD/JPY pair, at least for the time being. In fact, the outgoing BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said earlier this Friday that there is room to cut interest rates further into negative territory from the current -0.1%. This, in turn, warrants some caution for aggressive bearish traders and positioning for an extension of the recent downward trajectory witnessed over the past two weeks or so. Market participants now look forward to the release of the Michigan US Consumer Sentiment Index, due later during the early North American session, for short-term trading opportunities. The focus, however, will remain glued to the outcome of the highly-anticipated FOMC monetary policy meeting, scheduled to be announced next Wednesday. Nevertheless, the USD/JPY pair remains on track to register a third successive week of losses and should continue to take cues from the broader sentiment surrounding the Greenback.
