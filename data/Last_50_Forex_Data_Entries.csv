2025-04-10,USDJPY,Negative,Forex Today Yen gains in rough waters ahead of Fed SNB BoE and PMIs,Matías Salord,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/forex-today-yen-gains-in-rough-waters-ahead-of-fed-snb-boe-and-pmis-202303171900,FX Street,"Here is what you need to know for next week Wall Street indexes ended higher a volatile week as traders sail in rough waters. The Nasdaq gained more than 4%, on a bumpy trip. The VIX moderated, rising around 2% over the week, but is up 25% from the level it had a months ago. Banking concerns again dominated price action across financial markets. European and Asian indices closed with weekly losses. What it started a week ago with theSilicon Valley Bank(SVB), continued with Signature Bank, Credit Suisse (that stays on the lookout) and the First Republic Bank. Financial market turbulences will remain centre-stage over the next days. Next Wednesday, the Fed will likely raise interest rates by 25 bps, despite market tensions. If the US central stays on hold afraid of the current context, it could trigger a shock in markets that could offset the positive news of a pause of the tightening cycle. The clues about the future will be watched closely. China on Monday is seen leaving rates unchanged. US Treasurieshad the biggest weekly gains in years. Yields across the globe collapse as investors fly to quality amid rising odds of interest rate cuts before year-end. The Japanese Yen was the main winner among currencies of this context.USD/JPYlost almost 300 pips. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) posted the lowest weekly close in five weeks. The deterioration in market sentiment did not boost the Greenback enough. If systemic risk fears start to dominate price action the DXY could make a strong comeback. TheEuropean Central Bank(ECB) raised interest rates by 50 basis points as expected and dropped forward guidance. Economic data is being overshadowed by current developments; however, next week’s PMIs will gather attention. French President Emmanuel Macron will face a non-confidence vote next week. The banking crisis weighed on the Euro.EUR/GBPposted the lowest close since mid-January. EUR/USD ended the week flat looking at the 1.0700 area, after holding above critical 1.0500.Better-than-expected economic data from the UK offered support to the Pound. GBP/USD had the best weekly performance since mid-January, rising toward 1.2200. Next week, Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee will met. Market participants expect a final 25 basis points rate hike. TheSwiss francwas hit by the banking chaos, that included the Credit Suisse. The situation forced the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to take action. The SNB will announce its monetary policy decision on Thursday. February’s inflation in Switzerland surprised on the upside, but the current turmoil could keep the SNB away from another hike. Again USD/CHF rebounded sharply from near 0.9000, to the 20-week Simple Moving Average. EUR/CHF rose from four-week lows past 0.9900. USD/CADfinished the week lower around 1.3700 but far from the bottom. Next week, the key report from the Canadian economy will be February’s ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) on Tuesday. The kiwi was among the biggest gainers despite weak New Zealand Q4 GDP data. The AUD/USDhad the best week in months, helped by a weaker US Dollar and also by upbeat Australian employment data. Goldis another major winner rising more than a hundred dollar during the week, approaching $2,000. The yellow metal is also benefiting from risk aversion and the reversal in bond yields. Bitcoinkeeps moving north and is back above $26,500 after rising more than 20% during the week. It was a wild week for emerging market currencies. USD/MXN jumped for the second week in a row.

However, fears of more banking sector rout and anxiety ahead of this week’s top-tier data/events probe the Aussie pair buyers of late. Christopher Kent, Assistant Governor (Financial Markets), gave a speech on ""Long and Variable Monetary Policy Lags"" at the KangaNews Debt Capital Market Summit, in Sydney, early Monday morning in Asia-Pacific. The policymaker initially followed the suit of global central bankers while trying to rule out fears of the US and European banking sector fallout. More importantly, RBA’s Kent said that RBA is very conscious of the challenges facing borrowers from rapid rate rises. Also read:RBA’s Kent: Australian banks are unquestionably strong Apart from the cautious optimism spread by comments from RBA’s Kent, news that the UBS is up for buying the troubled Credit Suisse also offered a sigh of relief to the market sentiment and propelled the risk-barometer AUD/USD pair. It should, however, be noted that the news shares by Reuters suggesting two more banks are struggling in Europe seemed to have poked the AUD/USD bulls. On the same line could be the market’s cautious mood ahead of the key Federal Reserve (Fed) Monetary Policy meeting.

During the last week, the fallout of the US and European banks propelled the market’s move towards the US bond andGold, which in turn drowned the US Dollar while fuelling the AUD/USD prices. In addition to the downbeat yields, the US Dollar also had to bear the burden of downbeat US inflation and Retail Sales data. On Friday, US Consumer Confidence per the University of Michigan's (UoM) Consumer Confidence Index dropped to 63.4 for March versus 67.0 expected and prior. The details suggest that the year-ahead inflation expectations receded from 4.1% in February to 3.8%, the lowest reading since April 2021, while the 5-year counterpart dropped to 2.8% from 2.9% previous reading. Furthermore, US Industrial Production remained unchanged in February versus 0.2% expected and January's 0.3% (revised from 0%) expansion. Amid these plays, Wall Street closed with losses and the US two-year Treasury bond yields dropped the most in three years. Having witnessed the initial market reaction to comments from RBA’s Kent, AUD/USD traders may have to rely on the risk catalysts amid a light calendar on Monday, as well as a cautious mood ahead of the key Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) monetary policy meeting. It's worth noting that Tuesday’s RBA Meeting Minutes and Thursday’s preliminary readings of Australia’s March month S&P Global PMIs will also be important to observe for fresh impulse.

Finally, Credit Suisse is going to be taken over by UBS as the Swiss authorities persuaded the latter on Sunday to make a bid for a takeover. The news came just after some of the world's top central banks started to offer daily loans in US dollars to their banks to reduce any stress in the financial system. In this globally coordinated response, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has also stepped in along with the Bank of Canada (BoC), Bank of Japan (BoJ), Swiss National Bank (SNB), andthe European Central Bank (ECB). The liquidity injection will be done through swap lines, where central banks can offer US Dollar operations with seven-day maturity. The emergency swap line was first introduced during the COVID pandemic to ease US Dollar availability. Prior to this joint effort, the Fed had already opened the discount window for commercial banks, and the banks have borrowed nearly $164 billion amid this liquidity crisis. As a result, we have seen a slight spike in the Fed balance sheet despite the ongoing Quantitative Tightening (QT) program. One can attribute this as a mini version of QE, which is contrary to the ongoing QT. We have seen the same scenario with theBoEa while ago during the pension fund crisis. It seems contagion in the global banking sectors is not looking to be tamed yet, citing some Reuters reports.

The Cable has found support as the appeal for the US Dollar Index (DXY) is declining amid rising expectations of a less-hawkish monetary policy by the Federal Reserve (Fed). S&P500 futures are showing significant gains in the Asian session as UOB has confirmed a buyout for Credit Suisse. This has improved the risk appetite of the market participants as investors’ confidence is getting restored. Sky News reported that under the takeover UBS will pay 3bn Swiss francs (£2.6bn) to acquire Credit Suisse. And, it has agreed to assume up to 5bn francs (£4.4bn) in losses, and 100bn Swiss francs (£88.5bn) in liquidity assistance will be available to both banks. The USD Index is observing a restrictive upside around 103.80 as banking shakedown in the United States has faded hawkish guidance delivered by Fed chair Jerome Powell, a few weeks back. Inflation has dropped and the requirement of providing assistance to commercial banks is favoring the need for a lower interest rate hike, just to maintain pressure on stubborn inflation. Analysts at Danske Bank see theFedraising rates by 25 basis points (bps) despite recent turmoil amid banking sector jitters. On the United Kingdom front, investors are awaiting the interest rate decision by theBank of England(BoE), scheduled for Thursday. Analysts at Rabobank also see a quarter-point rate increase and warn that such a scenario is not fully priced in the interest market, “which indicates that the chance of a hold has increased following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).” A 25 bps rate hike by BoE Governor Andrew Bailey would push rates to 4.25%.

Even so, the Cable pair remains mildly bid while printing a three-day winning streak. That said, a downward-sloping resistance line from late January, around 1.2210 by the press time, appears a tough nut to crack forthe GBP/USD pairbuyers amid nearly overbought RSI (14) and mildly bullish MACD signals. Also acting as an upside hurdle is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the quote’s fall from late January to early March, around the 1.2200 round figure. It should be noted that the mid-February top surrounding 1.2270 appears the last defense of the GBP/USD bears, a break of which could propel the Cable price towards the 2023 top marked in January around 1.2450. On the flip side, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of 1.2125 could lure intraday sellers of the GBP/USD pair but a convergence of the 50-EMA and one-week-old ascending support line, near 1.2085, appears a tough nut to crack for the bears to retake control. Also acting as an important support is the 100-EMA level surrounding 1.2060, a break of which won’t hesitate to challenge multiple lows marked during late February, around 1.1930-20.

It is currently trading unchanged.. In the early Asian hours, risk appetite expanded along with some high beta currencies on the back of coordinated efforts from major central banks on the liquidity crunch. Last week we saw many commercial banks starting to fall one by one, with Credit Suisse being among the largest. Swiss authorities urged UBS to acquire the troubled Credit Suisse during the weekend. At the same time, other major central banks like the Federal Reserve (Fed),Bank of England(BoE), European Central Bank (ECB), and Swiss National Bank (SNB) took coordinated efforts to alleviate the liquidity crisis. TheFedhas opened its swap line to supply US Dollars to some major central banks to ease any liquidity drain on the US Dollar front, as it is the world reserve currency. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains isolated from this dollar bidding program, citing no financial stress evidence yet. That being said, two European commercial banks are under scrutiny for liquidity contagion, which could be a possible reason for investors to become cautious despite the swap line. On the other side, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) kept its benchmark rate unchanged as they had already cut the Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) by 25 bps on Friday. The consistent easing from PBoC is widening the yield differential with others and is likely to keep capital outflows intact. Some earlier comments from Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Assistant Governor Christopher Kent stated that the bank would consider financial conditions for the next policy meeting but downplayed the current scenario by saying it's just a small number of poorly managed banks. All eyes are set on the FOMC meeting if they are still to deliver a 25 basis point (bps) rate hike, and if yes, what will be the forward guidance? The most likely scenario could be a done deal, but be ready for any surprise.

The appeal for the Japanese Yen as a safe-haven has improved amid potential fears of global banking turmoil led by rising interest rates by western central banks. S&P500 futures have turned negative after surrendering significant gains generated in the early morning session, portraying extremely negative market sentiment, despite UBS rescuing Credit Suisse. Bloomberg reported Finma Chief Urban Angehrn says US regulators support the UBS deal to buy Credit Suisse for $3.3 billion. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is struggling to sustain above the 103.80 resistance. It seems that forward anxiety ahead of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) monetary policy is missing from the market. USD/JPY is declining toward the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement (placed from January 16 low at 127.22 to March 08 high at 137.91) at 131.30 on a four-hour scale. The declining 10-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 132.35 indicates that the downside momentum is extremely strong. Adding to that, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) has slipped into the bearish range of 20.00-40.00, which promises weakness further. It seems that the downside pressure would continue if the asset will surrender last week’s low at 131.55. An occurrence of the same would drag the asset toward January 23 high around 130.89 followed by February 10 low at 129.80. In an alternate scenario, a break above the 38.2% Fibo retracement at 133.83 would strengthen the US Dollar bulls.

The major is oscillating in a narrow range of 1.2168-1.2203. The Cable is struggling to deliver decisive action and is showing a subdued performance as investors are awaiting interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and theBank of England(BoE), which will be announced on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. S&P500 futures are displaying sheervolatility. The 500-US stocks basket has surrendered its entire gains generated in early Asia. It seems that UBS’s rescue plan for Credit Suisse has failed to cheer market participants. Credit Suisse shareholders were deprived of a vote on the deal and will receive one share in UBS for every 22.48 shares they own, valuing the bank at $3.15bn (£2.6bn), as reported by BBC News. Various central banks have come forward to provide liquidity assistance to rescue the second-largest Swiss bank in order to revive the confidence of consumers. The announcement of liquidity assistance to revive the 164-year-old bank has impacted demand for US governmentbonds. The 10-year US Treasury yields have scaled above 3.42% as higher liquidity flush could propel inflationary pressures again. Key event of the week- Federal Reserve policy The whole arena would go through nail-biting moments as the Federal Reserve (Fed) would announce its March monetary policy in times when fears of banking turmoil are deepening sharply. It seems unrealistic that Fed chair Jerome Powell would undermine the potential banking meltdown and will only focus on bringing down the stubborn inflation. Federal Reserve policymakers are delighted with the fact that January’s inflation data was a one-time blip as February’s inflation indicators displayed the continuation of inflation softening. Therefore, the Federal Reserve would be relieved even if it announces second 25 basis points (bps) interest rate hike. In a recent poll by Reuters, 76 of 82 economists believe that the US Federal Reserve would raise its policy rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.75-5% following the March Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. BoE to choose from a dismal economic outlook and double-digit inflation Unlike other economies, the United Kingdom has been facing issues with a dismaleconomic outlook, political instability along with persistent inflationary pressures. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey remained in a fix last year in choosing between growth and inflation. Shortages of labor and higher food inflation have remained major supporters of rampant inflation. No doubt, the Bank of England has been restricting its monetary policy to bring down the galloping inflation. The interest rate has already reached 4%. However, fresh concerns of the global banking fiasco are expected to add to more troubles for the Bank of England policymakers. Therefore, the street is not convinced about further rate hikes for now. Analysts at Rabobank also see a quarter-point rate increase and warn that such a scenario is not fully priced in the interest market, “which indicates that the chance of a hold has increased following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).” A 25 bps rate hike by BoE Governor Andrew Bailey would push rates to 4.25%. The action from the Pound Sterling would not be restricted to the monetary policy from the Bank of England. Wednesday’s ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) data is going to drive the Bank of England’s decision-making ahead. As per the estimates, the annual headline CPI is expected to trim to 9.8% from the former release of 10.1%. While the core CPI that excludes oil and food prices would remain steady at 5.8%. GBP/USD technical outlook  GBP/USD has witnessed a solid upside move after testing the breakout zone of the Falling Channel chart pattern formed on a daily scale. The Cable is approaching the horizontal resistance plotted from December 14 high at 1.2447. The 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.2080 is providing cushion to the Pound Sterling bulls.

Spot prices, however, manage to rebound a few pips in the last hour and currently trades around the 131.00 mark, still down over 0.60% for the day. The prevalent risk-off environment - as reflected by an extended sell-off around the equity markets amid fears of a full-blown banking crisis - drives some haven flows towards the Japanese Yen (JPY) and weighs heavily on the USD/JPY pair. Despite the recent emergency liquidity measures and multi-billion-dollar lifelines for troubled US and European banks, market participants remain concerned about the contagion risk. This, along with looming recession risks, takes its toll on the global risk sentiment and forces investors to take refuge in traditional safe-haven assets. That said, a modest US Dollar (USD) strength assists the USD/JPY pair to find some support ahead of the mid-130.00s and stall its sharp intraday downfall. The USD uptick, however, remains limited amid the ongoing slump in the US Treasury bond yields. The anti-risk flow, along with diminishing odds for a more aggressive policy tightening by the Fed, lead to a further steep fall in the US bond yields. This comes after the rate-sensitive 2-year US government bond last week recorded its biggest three-day fall since Black Monday in October 1987 and should cap the buck. The aforementioned fundamental backdrop suggests that the path of least resistance for the USD/JPY pair is to the downside. That said, traders might refrain from placing fresh bearish bets and prefer to move to the sidelines ahead of the two-day FOMC meeting, starting this Tuesday. TheFedwill announce its policy decision during the US session on Wednesday, which will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics.

The momentum remains uninterrupted through the early North American session and lifts spot prices to over a one-month high, around the 1.2240 region in the last hour. An intraday turnaround in the global risk sentiment - as depicted by a solid recovery in the US equity futures - drags the safe-haven US Dollar (USD) to its lowest level since February 14, which, in turn, acts as a tailwind for the GBP/USD pair. The USD is further pressured by diminishing odds for a more aggressive policy tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed), especially after the recent collapse of two mid-size US banks - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. In fact, the markets are now pricing in a smaller 25 bps lift-off at the end of a two-day FOMC monetary policy meeting, starting this Tuesday. The US central bank is also expected to start cutting interest rates during the second half of the year, which had led to the recent sharp downfall in the US Treasury bond yields. It is worth recalling that the rate-sensitive 2-year US government bond last week recorded its biggest three-day slump since Black Monday in October 1987. That said, some repositioning trade ahead of the key central bank event risk pushes the US bond yields high, albeit does little to impress the USD bulls. This, along with the possibility of some short-term trading stops being triggered above the 1.2200 mark, further contributes to the bid tone surrounding the GBP/USD pair. It, however, remains to be seen if the intraday positive move is backed by genuine buying or turns out to be a stop run, warranting some caution for bulls. In the absence of any major market-movingeconomic dataon Monday, the focus will remain glued to the FOMC decision on Wednesday and theBank of Englandpolicy meeting on Thursday. Apart from this, traders, this week will confront the release of the latest consumer inflation figures from the UK on Wednesday.

The pair, however, keeps the red for the second straight day and trades just above the 131.50 region during the early North American session, down less than 0.15% for the day. From a technical perspective, the intraday failure near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally from the January monthly swing low exerts heavy pressure on the USD/JPY pair amid the emergence of fresh US Dollar selling. That said, spot prices struggle to find bearish acceptance below the 61.8% Fibo. level amid an intraday turnaround in the global risk sentiment, which tends to undermine the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY). Apart from this, the Fed-Bank of Japan (BoJ) policyoutlookturns out to be another factor that assists the USD/JPY pair to attract some buyers at lower levels. Traders also opt to lighten their bearish bets ahead of the highly-anticipated FOMC monetary policy meeting, starting this Tuesday. TheFedwill announce its decision on Wednesday, which will drive the USD demand and help determine the next leg of a directional move for the major. In the meantime, any subsequent recovery is more likely to confront some resistance near the 132.00 mark ahead of the 50% Fibo. level, around the 132.60-132.65 region. A sustained move beyond has the potential to lift the USD/JPY pair back towards the 133.00 round figure en route to the next relevant hurdle near the 133.50 region. This is closely followed by 38.2% Fibo. level, around the 133.80 zone, which should now act as a pivotal point. On the flip side, the daily swing low, around the 130.55-130.50 region, now seems to protect the immediate downside. Some follow-through selling will confirm a bearish breakdown and make the USD/JPY pair vulnerable to challenging the 130.00 psychological mark.

An improvement in market mood and European Central Bank (ECB) speakers lend a hand to the Euro (EUR), while the US Dollar (USD) continues to weaken across the board. At the time of writing, the EUR/USD is trading at 1.0720. Germany’s PPI and ECB speaking among the factors boosting the Euro Market sentiment improved after UBS bought its Swiss rival Credit Suisse. The financial market turbulence has spurred speculations that global central banks could pause the pace of tightening. However, traders expect a 25 bps rate hike by the Federal Reserve (Fed) on Wednesday. The CME FedWatch Tool odds for a quarter of a percentage point lift at 73.10%. The EUR/USD price action has been driven by ECB speakers. ThePresident of the ECB,Christine Lagarde, said that inflation is expected to continue excessively high for a more extended period. She added that there’s no trade-off between inflation and financial stability, and without tensions, the ECB would’ve indicated that additional rate hikes were required. At around the same time, ECB’s Stoumaras commented the ECB would not give more forward guidance and said that meetings would be data dependant. Earlier, Germany’s inflation in the producer side, known as theProducer Price Index(PPI), contracted -0.3% MoM, less than estimates of -0.5%. Annually basis, the PPI jumped 15.45, above forecasts of 14.5%. Aside from this, last Friday’s US economic data revealed that Industrial Production experienced a -0.2% YoY decrease, marking the first contraction in the past year. The monthly reading was 0%, lower than the estimated 0.2%. Additionally, Consumer Sentiment in the US, as measured by the University of Michigan (UoM), decreased from 67 in February to 63.4 in March, the first drop in four months. The US Dollar Index, a measure of the buck’s value, extended its losses to 0.44%, down at 103.417, a tailwind for the EUR/USD. US Treasury bond yields are recovering but failing to underpin the greenback. EUR/USD Technical analysis The EUR/USD has printed three consecutive bullish candles, though it remains shy of testing last week’s high of 1.0759. The daily chart suggests a triple bottom is in place, though it would need to reclaim the latter to confirm its validity.

However, on Wednesday, the price fell below the swing area as issues with Credit Suisse, the ECB rate decision, and First Republic fallout led to a shift from EUR to USD. Despite initial downward movement on Thursday and Friday, the price gradually increased. During today's trading, the price initially dipped in the Asian and early European sessions, briefly breaking below the 100-hour moving average (blue line in the chart above) and the 200-hour moving average (green line on the chart above).

The major currency asset is expected to extend its journey toward the critical resistance of 1.0750 ahead. The shared currency pair has registered a three-day winning streak and is expected to extend further as investors are skeptical about the interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve (Fed), which is scheduled for Wednesday. A late recovery in S&P500 allowed it to settle Monday’s session on a decent positive note. It seems that investors cheered the collaborative efforts made by various financial institutions to rescue the First Republic after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank. The recovery move byUnited Statesequities is portraying a decent attempt for bulls to settle their feet. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is expected to settle on a negative note consecutively for the third time as investors are still ambiguous about Fed’s monetary policy. As per the CME Fedwatch tool, more than 76% odds are in favor of a 25 basis point (bps) interest rate hike, which would push rates to 4.75-5.00%. However, the efforts by various central banks to safeguard the global economy from potential banking turmoil indicate that Fed chair Jerome Powell could pause further rate hikes to restore confidence among the market participants. The discussions over the interest rate guidance could soften the US Dollar for a longer period. Economists at Scotiabank believe that the US Dollar could weaken if the market believes that theFedis near to end of its tightening cycle.

That said, the Aussie pair makes rounds to 0.6715-20 after rising in the last three consecutive days. The Aussie pair’s latest gains could be linked to the market’s easing fears of the banking sector collapse, as well as the cautious optimism showed by Christopher Kent, Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) Assistant Governor (Financial Markets). Adding to the quote’s upside momentum could be the upbeat performance of Gold and softer Treasury bond yields, which in turn exerted downside pressure on the US Dollar. That said, RBA’s Kent spoke a speech on ""Long and Variable Monetary Policy Lags"" at the KangaNews Debt Capital Market Summit, in Sydney, early Monday morning, while saying that the Australian banks are unquestionably strong. The policymaker also said that RBA is very conscious of the challenges facing borrowers from rapid rate rises. Elsewhere, news of UBS’ takeover of the troubled Credit Suisse, by paying 3 billion Swiss francs (£2.6bn), also eased the market’s fears. On the same line were statements from the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) mentioning that the deposits of Signature Bridge Bank will be assumed by a subsidiary of New York Community Bancorporation. Furthermore, around five major banks joined the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to ease the US Dollar liquidity crunch via currency swaps and added strength to the market’s risk-on mood. “The Bank of Canada,Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, Federal Reserve, and Swiss National Bank are all up for announcing joint actions to provide more liquidity via standing US dollar liquidity swap line arrangements,” said Reuters. It should be noted, however, that a Senior Swiss lawmaker warned on Monday that “the UBS-Credit Suisse merger is an enormous risk,” which in turn probed the optimists amid the market’s anxiety ahead of this week’s top-tier data/events. Against this backdrop, the US Dollar Index (DXY) dropped to the lowest levels in a month while the US Treasury bond yields stays pressured. Further, Wall Street closed on the positive side whereGold pricerefreshed Year-To-Date (YTD) high before retreating to $1,980 at the latest. To sum up, the AUD/USD buyers are likely to keep the reins amid the firmer sentiment and the hawkish RBA talks. However, today’s RBA Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes will be crucial to watch as the bulls may want to reconfirm policymaker Kent’s hawkish bias. That said, the Aussie central bank announced a 0.25% rate hike in the last meeting and appeared a bit tense over the future rate increase.

This comes amid speculation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may not pursue aggressive rate hikes as anticipated due to the recent banking turmoil. On Monday, the US dollar weakened as investors responded to UBS's acquisition of its struggling competitor, Credit Suisse, for CHF 3 billion. Following the global banking crisis, the US Dollar is losing its safe-haven status, while the Japanese Yen has regained its conventional safe-haven status. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank earlier this month sent shockwaves through the markets, causing a plunge in banking stocks and concerns that central bank monetary tightening could lead to a recession. In response to the ongoing banking crisis, the Fed has opened swap lines to other central banks to provide US Dollar liquidity. This move may contribute to the downward pressure on US Dollar demand. Investors are cautiously watching the Fed's decision on Wednesday's conclusion of a two-day meeting. Before the banking turmoil, many market participants had expected a 50 basis point (bps) interest rate hike from the Fed at its March meeting. However, Fed funds futures now indicate a 28.4% probability of the Fed maintaining its overnight rate at 4.5%-4.75%, and a 71.6% likelihood of a 25 bps increase, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.

While the first of the expected four rate hikes recently gone, the policymaker was asked in an interview on Austrian national broadcaster ORF TV if he stood by that call given recent turbulence in the banking sector, when ECB’s Holzmann said: ""I would not rule them out but I would also not say that they will necessarily come either."" ECB’s Holzmann also mentioned that since his Handelsblatt interview liquidity in the financial system had decreased, referring to banking stocks' recent fall on fears of a new banking crisis. ""What we are concerned with is fighting inflation,"" ECB’s Holzmann said, adding that if deflation or an inflation reduction began because of tightening liquidity, the central bank would no longer need to raise rates or could raise them more gradually.

The Telegraph conveys multiple analysts’ estimations while saying, “The Bank of England (BoE) will be forced to abandon an interest rate rise this week following turmoil in global financial markets.” The forecasts become too important ahead of the “Super Thursday” as some on the floor expected a 50 bps rate hike from the “Old Lady”, as the BoE is casually known. On the other hand, BBC News quotes Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson as saying that the agreement was not sufficient to deal with concerns that his party had raised about post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland. “The DUP has confirmed that it will oppose the deal - known as the Windsor Framework - when MPs are given a vote on part of it on Wednesday,” adds BBC News.

The Australian central bank teased policy doves by announcing a softer rate hike of 0.25% in its latest meeting, which in turn raised expectations that the pivot is in play. The same could be confirmed from the latest comments of the RBA officials and make it important for the policy hawks to step back. As a result, today’s RBA Minutes will be closely observed for the details on the latest decision which raised bearish bets on the AUD/USD as it rises of late. Also important inside the Minutes statement, especially for the AUD/USD pair traders, will be the economic outlook and the central bankers’ optimism towards overcoming the recession fears amid the banking sector fallouts. How could the minutes affect AUD/USD? AUD/USD portrays the market’s pre-event anxiety as it makes rounds to 0.6715-20 after rising in the last three consecutive days. The Aussie pair previously cheered the market’s easing fears of the banking sector collapse, as well as the cautious optimism showed by Christopher Kent, Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) Assistant Governor (Financial Markets). That said, the Aussie pair’s further upside hinges on how the RBA Minutes manage to keep the bulls happy even after promoting the ability to announce further rate hikes. That being said, talks over the economic transition and neutral rate, as well as surrounding employment conditions, will also be crucial to watch for short-termAUD/USD forecast. Technically, clear upside break of the six-week-old descending resistance line, now immediate support around 0.6635, directs AUD/USD buyers towards the 100-DMA hurdle of near 0.6765.

Looking back to February 27 through March 7, the price bottomed in that area before breaking lower on March 7 on its way to its low price which was reached on March 10 at 0.65634. Admittedly the price has traded above that the old swing area on a number of occasions last week as market volatility led to extensions to the upside that for the most part failed. Earlier today there was a failure on the top side as well. However with the price back above that swing area (and the 100 hour moving average finding willing buyers as well), the buyers are more in control. The high price earlier today reached a 0.67295 and remains the next key target. Above that is the 50% midpoint at 0.67417. Risk for traders looking for more upside is the swing area down to 0.66910.

Monetary policy was already in restrictive territory and theeconomic outlookwas uncertain. Members ""agreed to reconsider the case for a pause at the following meeting, recognising that pausing would allow additional time to reassess the outlook for the economy,"" according to the minutes. The Board reiterated that further tightening of the monetary would likely be required given inflation was still too high, the labor market tight and business surveys showed solid activity. The RBA noted that recent data releases on Gross Domestic Product, jobs, wages and inflation, had come in softer than expected, but the shortfalls to expectations were not large. The Board said they would be watching upcoming releases on employment, inflation, retail trade and business surveys, as well as the developments in the global economy at the April meeting.

A shift in interest rate repricing has caused the UST yield to enter a corrective decline. The three-day bullish rally for EUR/USD has led to a retest of the descending trendline that originates from February's high at the 1.1036 level. The descending trendline intersects the 38.2% Fibonacci level at the 1.0720 mark, coinciding with the 50-Day Moving Average (DMA). This convergence of factors creates a significant and challenging resistance. A decisive break above this level could propel the price towards a series of resistances, starting with last week's high at 1.0753, followed by the 50% Fibonacci level. The final line of resistance would be the 61.8% Fibonacci level. Any pullback will likely be limited around the 23.6% Fibonacci level, which coincides with the 21-DMA. A convincing break below this point could send EUR/USD down to the multi-month low of 1.0525, the last line of support. As we approach an importantFedmeeting, it is not uncommon for investors to be polarized regarding policy decisions. Consequently, the pair is likely to tread water ahead of the event.

Even so, the Aussie pair’s successful trading beyond the previous resistance line from early February, near 0.6625 by the press time, join the bullish MACD signals to keep the buyers hopeful. That said, a clear upside break of the 21-EMA, around 0.6720 by the press time, could direct the AUD/USD buyers towards the 0.6780-85 resistance confluence including 100-EMA, 50-EMA and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of October 2022 to February 2023 upside. Hence, the AUD/USD pair appears to remain sidelined between 0.6780-85 resistance and 0.6625 resistance-turned-support line. It should be noted that a sustained break of 0.6785 could aim for the mid-February high surrounding 0.7030 wherein the 0.7000 round figure and early February’s low of 0.6855 may act as buffers. Alternatively, a downside break of the stated trend line support, previous resistance around 0.6625, may aim for the 0.6600 round figure before approaching the monthly low of 0.6564. Even if the quote drops below 0.6564, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, also known as the golden Fibonacci ratio, could challenge the AUD/USD bears around 0.6545.

Although US Treasury (UST) bond yields were boosted on Monday, USD/JPY failed to capitalize significantly. This can be attributed to the struggling global banking sector, as many commercial banks faltered last week. Consequently, investors rushed to purchase USTbonds, causing yields to decline. USD/JPYclosely follows the UST yield direction, so, unsurprisingly, the US Dollar remains under pressure. Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve restarted swap lines to provide US Dollar liquidity to central banks in need, in addition to the Fed's discount window. This rapid action has flooded the market with excess US Dollar liquidity, resulting in widespread weakness. As the market heads toward Wednesday's FOMC meeting, caution is advised. The global banking system is already strained, and a further increase in borrowing costs could exacerbate existing issues. The market anticipates a 25 basis point (bps) rate hike from the Fed. Trading during the FOMC event requires extra caution, as this meeting differs from a typical one with pre-set expectations. With investors divided over various variables,volatilityis expected. It is always recommended to be especially careful, as the market could reverse during the press conference.
